<P>...Out riding with a few friends, the tre wouldn't start anymore when after a break. The last miles before
 the break there was a different noise from the engine that was new for me.....<br>
When I start the engine now, it looks like the starter engine misses the teeth of the flywheel.</p>

<p>The Benelli is home again (10 km walking with a benelli in your arms is not something you will do daily)<br>
I dismantled the left cowling and removed the starter engine. The starter engine seems to be OK.<br>
The sound the benelli makes (is) like starting a car which is already running<br>
The toothweel which is driven by the starterengine has some axial movement<br>
IS THAT NORMAL. I can't (find anything) about it in the manual</p>

<p>Hey, it sounds like the generator/starter motor drive gear on the back of the clutch. Benelli sent us new
 clutch baskets with thicker gears to replace all the earlier models with the week gears. You should be able
 to still get a new clutch basket free of charge from the selling dealer, but be warned, replace the gear
 that mesh's with it as although it will look okay, we have found that it will lose a couple of teeth down
 the track and it'll all happen again for you.<br>

This is an easy repair, you'll need a rattle gun to undo the clutch nut, but the whole job should take about
 2 hours.</p>

Took me 3 hours to fit them, yee ha! I reckon the Tornado boys should get onto these. I had thought that my
 Tornado's were struggling on the starter motor. Everyone thought it was weak batteries or cables....no way,
 this is like a new bike</P>
