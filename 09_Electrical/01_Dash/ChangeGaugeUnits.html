<P>1. Hold the mode button down for 2 seconds<br>
2. Turn the ignition on while the Mode button is still down<br>
3. Keep holding the Mode switch down for another 5-10 seconds, until the units change mode appears<br>
4. Select between mph & kph.<br>
5. Do it again, and you can select between C & F on the temperature scale.</p>

<p>The temperature value in the bottom right of the LCD read-out, is sensed by a thermistor inside the front
 fairing, to the right of the headlight.</P>

<p>(Thanks to Neil [n33ly from the Benelliforum] for clarifying step 3.<br>
Laurence [Benelliforum] also reckons that step 1 is not necessary. Pressing the Mode switch for around 10 seconds once the
 ignition is on will work as well. I haven't checked this, but I'm sure Laurence is right.)
