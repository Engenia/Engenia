<p>The lights on a Tornado are great for the Autobahn, but next to useless in a mountain pass. While the high beam
 projects a great distance, there's next to no spread. This makes it particularly difficult to negotiate tight
 corners at speed. You just can't see far enough into the corner.</p>

<p>It helps to hold the flasher button down, with low beam selected, to get a little more spread. Still not
 brilliant, but better.</p>
<p>If you get sick of holding your flasher button down, change your lighting circuit, as follows, to keep the low
 beam ON, when the high beam is selected.</p>

The schematic at left, shows a diode connected between the hot side of the high beam relay coil, and the
 corresponding point on the low beam relay coil. This keeps the low beam coil energised at all times, when the
 lights are on. The white loom at the top (right picture), contains the diode, housed in clear heatshrink.</p>

<p>(The large red wires place a fuse in series with each of the low & high beam lamps. This is in preparation for
 installing a pair of 55W High Intensity Discharge lamps.)</p>
