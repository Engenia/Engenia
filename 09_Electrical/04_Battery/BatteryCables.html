The Tornado (and TNT) suffers from too much voltage drop on the battery cables during cranking. This
 results in sluggish cranking and contributes to the resetting clocks problem.
 The existing cables are each 1m long and use 8mm² wire. The total resistance is 0.005 ohms, which causes
 a 0.625V drop if the battery can deliver 125A. That's 78 W that's not spinning the engine.
 Not hopeless, but half that is better, and of course when the engine is hot, the starter will draw a lot
 more current (~200 A). Then the drop is closer to 1 V and you've lost 200 W just in the wires.
<br>
Due to the restricted space under the battery, an additional 8mm² cable set was added, rather than replacing
 the existing cables with 16mm². There is space to add another set if desired, for a total of 24mm², but that
 is probably over-kill.
<br>
The terminal bolts need to be longer, to accommodate the extra lug. M6 x 15mm worked for me, but depends on
 the lug thickness.<br>
The positive cable is 1000 mm long.<br>
The negative cable is  800 mm long.

Cable routing under the battery.

Positive connection to the solenoid (pardon the focus - the camera lied)

Negative connection, 200 mm shorter,  bolted to the rear of the engine.

The result is crisper, faster cranking.<br>
The TNT especially will benefit from fitting larger cables, as stated by

 upgrade shown above, however, refers only to the Tornado.
