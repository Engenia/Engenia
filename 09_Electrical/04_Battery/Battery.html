<p>We all know that this battery barely produces the goods. What we need is more CCAs
 -- lots more.<br>
The battery compartment is deeper at the base than the top, so a deeper, but lower battery,
 of suitable dimensions, will also fit. <b>KnowALittle</b> was the first to report that a
 153 x 87 x 111 unit will fit. This has been confirmed by yours truly.</p>

*Sealed non-spillable AGM battery<br>
*Maintenance-free<br>

<p>Some of the most powerful batteries in decreasing CCA (& cost!) order are :-</p>
<p>Yuasa YTZ14S - 150 x 87 x 110 - 230 CCA<br>
Yuasa YTZ12S - 150 x 87 x 110 - 210 CCA<br>
<a href="http://www.eastpenn-deka.com" target="_blank">Deka ETX9BS</a> - 150 x 88 x 106 - 120 CCA @ 0°F</p>
<p>The Deka spec is VERY conservative. I've seen it deliver 400 Amps, at 20°C. Not sure what the YTZ's can do
 at 20°C, probably even more, but they do retail for about AUD240, while the ETX9 comes in at about AUD160
 (mid 2007 prices)<br>
Since fitting the Deka ETX9, Nelli cranks faster and catches more easily. There's never been a hint of
 difficulty.</p>

The ETX9 had been having difficulty cranking a hot engine. Given 5 minutes, it'd be ok, but it didn't instil confidence.
 I tested it at 200 A at 25C, which is well down on what it was new, so it's time to do something about it.
 Laurence has managed to install a 150x87x130, so I thought I'd give it a go. The ETX9 is rated at 110 CCA, & the ETX12 at 180 CCA,
 so it should be a significant improvement.<br>
 When mounted with the terminals down, clearance is an issue. So I made up some terminal extenders, to shift the connection point a little higher.

Laurence is using a Shorai LFX18A1-BS12 and so is pilgrim.<br>
WikingTNT is using a Motocell Lithium Ion 20Ah / 360cca in his TNT<br>
I've been using an
 <a href="http://www.ssbpowersport.com.au/tabid/241/btsid/32/mode/showbatterytypes/LithiumBatteries.aspx" target="_blank">SSB Powersport LH12B-4</a>
  since November 2014, supplied to me by Autologic Services of Prestons NSW (04 1138 0254).<br />
  As a testament to Lithium batteries, I parked Nell in the garage in March 2016 and without any charging she fired straight up again in November.
  Try doing that with a lead-acid battery!<br />
  It's now August 2022 and it's still up to the task. That battery is rated at 400 CCA new. I had it tested yesterday and it can deliver 238 Amps.
  Nell needs 200 to start when hot, so it's near end of life. It's outlasted 2 lead acid batteries, so money well spent.
