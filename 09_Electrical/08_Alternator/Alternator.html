<P><STRONG>Cush Rubbers</STRONG><br>
The 903 can be quite brutal with these. I've seen a Triumph 955 with pristine rubbers at 100,000km,
 while Nell's were mauled at 30,000km. The Triumph rubbers appeared to be the same part.<br>
 <a href="http://www.benelliforum.com/forum/matching-parts-accessories-links/16505-alternator-cush-rubber.html#post158891" target="_blank">The Dane reported</a>
 that the cush rubbers from a Kawasaki ZX7R and ZX750N are a direct replacement.<br>

 This is his picture of them installed.<br />

  that the MV Augusta F4 uses the same rubbers.<br />

<P><STRONG>Stator</STRONG><br>
tractorman <a href="http://www.benelliforum.com/forum/tornado-tre/27594-need-alternator-tornado-tre-900-a-post235225.html#post235225" target="_blank" >reported
 on the forum</a> that the screws holding the bearing into the alternator cover came loose which resulted in the stator being damaged. A heap of Nippon Denso
 alternators were assessed and a stator from a Holden Barina was found to be the same diameter, soldered in and operated successfully. "These alternators are used
 in many cars but with different mountings and shafts ...."<br>
The Holden Barina has had six generations badge-engineered from the Suzuki Cultus, Opel Corsa, and Daewoo Kalos, so just which was the donor stator is not clear.<br>
If a stator is needed, a rumage through boxes of Nippon Denso alternators will turn up plenty of donors.
