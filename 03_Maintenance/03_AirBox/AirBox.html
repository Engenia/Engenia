<ol>
Remove:-
 <li>lower panels</li>
 <li>dash panels</li>
 <li>mirrors</li>
 <li>screen</li>
 <li>upper panels (lift tank @ rear a little to release)</li>
 <li>airbox inlet tubes</li>
 <li>the tank :-
  <ol type="i">
   <li>Remove the key surround</li>
   <li>Remove the front tank screws</li>
   <li>Remove the rear tank bolt</li>
   <li>Protect steering head upper plate with a substantial rag</li>
   <li>Lift the tank & place front bracket onto the upper plate</li>
   <li>disconnect the fuel line (Use the proper tool or you'll break it!)</li>
   <li>insert the fuel outlet bung</li>
   <li>disconnect the 2 overflow tubes</li>
   <li>disconnect the fuel pump cable</li>
   <li>lift it out & store in a safe place</li>
  </ol></li>

 <li>the airbox :-
  <ol type="i">
   <li>Remove the 9 off, M5 screws that hold the top of the airbox in place - 8 on the perimeter & 1 in the
 centre. You'll need a 3mm A/F hex key at least 90mm long.</li>
   <li>Remove the airbox top</li>
   <li>Remove the filter</li>
   <li>Disconnect the temp sensor</li>
   <li>Remove the two screws at the front of the airbox</li>
   <li>Now for the hard part........ (<i>see "Airbox Throttle Body Screws" below</i>)
    <ol type="a">
     <li>There are 3 hose clamps that fix the trumpets to the throttle bodies. You'll need a ball end, 3mm A/F 250 mm
 hex key.</li>
     <li>Set up a mirror between the radiator air tubes, so that you can see the screws just under the base of the
 airbox. Once you've done it a few times, you can go by feel. Just follow the band back to the cap screw, run up
 the head & into the socket.</li>
     <li>unscrew each about 10 turns</li>
    </ol></li>
   <li>Prise off the airbox from the throttle bodies. It'll be stiff, but it will move.</li>
   <li>Once it's popped up, rotate the airbox up and out. It's a tight fit.</li>
   <li>Disconnect the tip over switch.</li>
   <li>Remove the airbox completely</li>
  </ol></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<b>When it goes back together :-</b>
 <li>change the drain plug to a drain tube, in order to direct water away from #2 coil, to the front of the engine</li>
 <li>lubricate the throttle body / trumpet interface, with silicone grease.</li>
 <li>it's easier to install the air inlet tubes before the airbox is screwed down at the front. You may need to rotate
 them into position.</li>
 <li>don't forget to reconnect the temp sensor. It'll run rich without it, and foul the plugs.</li>
 <li>it won't run at all without the tip over switch or its bypass.</li>
</ol>

Jean has replaced the standard short cap screws with cap bolts to make it easier to find the screw heads under the airbox.
I haven't tried it, but it looks like he's Loctited a nut to the base of the threaded section to stop it from turning and
act as a stop.<br>
