<p>
Standard Shim Diameter is 8.0 mm.<br>
The shims sit in an indent under the Tappet Bucket. The surface tension of a film of oil will hold it in position, when
 the bucket is withdrawn.<br>
<a href="http://www.precisionshims.com.au" target="_blank">Precision Shims Australia</a> produce a range of 7.9mm dia.
 shims which work fine. Better than the originals, in fact, because they are harder, but still not hard enough for the Tornado 900,
 and I assume the Tornado 1130 as well.
 The shims tend to indent where the valve stem meets them due to the incredibly strong valve springs in the Tornado.
 I think I measured one set to be 1000 N. This makes it difficult to calculate the new shim size, as the depth of the indent
 can not be determined without removing the shim. One upside though, is that indenting the shim hardens it further,
 so the dent tends to reach a certain depth and then stops.</p>

<ol> <lh><b>The clearance adjustment method</b></lh>
 <li>Measure the current clearance (Cc)</li>
 <li>Measure the current shim thickness + a small ball bearing sitting in the indentation (Scb)</li>
 <li>Measure the ball diameter</li>
 <li>Subtract the ball diameter from Scb to get the actual shim thickness (Sc = Scb - ball)</li>
 <li>The total gap (T) = Cc + Sc</li>
 <li>Given the desired clearance (Cd), calculate the new shim thickness (Sn)<br>
   <center><b>Sn = T - Cd</b></center></li>
 <li>Choose the nearest standard shim thickness - generally in increments of 0.05mm.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>(Precision Shims may be able to select an exact shim thickness)</p>

<p>Of course, the difficulty in doing this, is in removing the shims for measurement and replacement. This requires that
 the cam shaft is removed. If you already know the current shim sizes, the down-time will be shorter. So keep a record
 of your current shim details. Of course, you will only know the actual shim thickness if you are using known indent hardened shims.<br>
 Keep your old shims, indented or not, an re-use them other positions</p>

<p>Refer to the cam chain replacement page,
 <a href="../../05_Engine/01_Camshaft/01_Remove/Preamble.html">Starting Here</a>, for details concerning it's
 removal and re-fitment.</p>

<p><b>Shim Indentation</b><br />
The valve stems hammer the shims repeatedly causing indentation because the valve springs are so so strong.
The springs must be strong enough to follow the cam profile up to the rev limit set in the ECU map, but no more than that.
<br>
JohnnyO, in his quest for more horsepower, and a better feel near the limit, from his racing Tornado,
discovered that he could raise the rev limit without encountering valve bounce.
The power curve was essentially linear right up to the limiter, which on the Tornado 900 is 11,500 rpm and on the RS 12,000 rpm.
<br />
This is fine for the track, but in the real world, well, my world, I rarely touch 10,000 rpm.
So it is conceivable that the valve springs could be replaced by those from a TNT 1130 Sport of even a TreK 1130 and reduce the
rev limiter to 10,500 or 9,500, respectively, without noticing any difference in performance. At least in the way I ride it.
This would have the distinct advantage of reducing the shim indentation. Perhaps even eliminating it.
<br />
I need to talk to Alex at Maniac about this one day. Perhaps I'll make the change to the spare engine I'm building. Tax's old 900.
