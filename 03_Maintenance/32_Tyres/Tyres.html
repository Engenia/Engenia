<P><b>Dunlop 209</b><br>
From <i>85GSXR - Benelliforum - </i> 29 June 2006<br>
If you plan on running the Dunlop 209 GP tires, make sure to space the rear mud guard/hugger/fender up and
 away from the rear tire by using spacers between the mud guard/hugger/fender and the swing arm. Longer
 screws help. I used some spare aluminum spacers from my race spares.<br>
The Dunlop 209's need about 10 to 12mm of clearance because of the growth of the diameter of the tire at
 high speeds.<br>
I've been wrenching on a local racer's GSXR 1000 for a part of this race season and working with Pirelli
 tires. They do not seem to have the growth problem of the Dunlops. We also run the Pirelli's at a much lower
 air pressure than the Dunlops.</P>

<p><b>Tyre Pressures</b><br>
From <i>JohnnyO - Benelliforum - </i> 13 Feb 2005<br>
Hi Guy's, from my experience, tyre pressures are different depending on the tyres used; for example, a
 rear Pirelli Super Corsa that has a very soft & flexible side wall, I would run 32 psi but a stiff carcass
 like a Dunlop I would run 27 psi. Now this is for solo riding and up in the windies where traction is the
 most important consideration.<br>

All bikes these day run more pressure in the front tyre as it has precise steering duties, where with the
 rear tyre, with a lower pressure will give a larger foot-print for better traction but also some carcass
 distortion to better follow surface irregularities.<br>

I think it is more important than other bikes to run higher pressures in the front tyre due the heavy front
 weight bias of the Tornado (radiator under the seat, engine further forward).<br>

I think as a general rule for most tyres with solo riders, I would go with 31 psi front and 29 psi rear.
 With a pillion; 34 psi in the rear.<br>

This is only my own personal advice, I have raced and worked in the motorcycle industry for 30 years,
 I hope I know what I'm doing by now?</p>

<p><b>Tyre Pressures - Pirelli's Recommendations</b><br>
<b>Strada</b> - Frank Obermeir from Pirelli Australia replied to my request for info:-<br>
<q>In the hommologation process all tyres are tested with the tyre pressure the manufacturer of the bike
 is recommending. So you can go for the same pressure on the Dunlops or Pirellis.</q><br>
(The Benelli Tornado User Manual recommends 36 psi front and 32 psi rear<br>
The Tornado Workshop Manual & Short Guide both recommend 36 psi front and 36 psi rear)<br>
<i>(190/50 rear circumference is 75.6" - at 5000km)</i><br>

<b>Corsa III</b><br>
- Street: 35 psi Front, 38 psi Rear<br>
<i>(new 180/55 rear circumference is 77.6")</i><br>
- Track: 32 psi Front, 34 psi Rear<br>

<p><b>Corsa vs Corsa III</b><br>
The Corsa III rear is a dual compound tyre, as opposed to the Corsa's single. Hence the increased longevity
 in normal road use.<br>
Some tyre fitters have suggested that the Corsa III front is the same as the Corsa front. Not so, as Frank
 Obermeier of Pirelli Australia (NZ) explains -<br>
"F.e. new high-stability structure materials were developed, designed to offer high and stable performance at
 mid & high temperatures independently from external conditions. As well the heat distribution through the tyre
 is improved and much more uniform.<br>

As well the contour shape of a tyre is very important and we have a new production process which keeps the tyre
 profile always in the most suitable shape."
