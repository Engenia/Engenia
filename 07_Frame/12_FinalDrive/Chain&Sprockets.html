(updated 15 Aug 2006)</center>

Original sprocket combination is 16 / 41<br>
Chain is 525 ---> (5/8" pitch, 2.5/8" wide [5/16"] ---- a 530 is 5/8" pitch & 3/8" wide --- a 520 is 1/4" wide)<br>
John Orchard recommends 15 / 43. Top speed will drop to around 235kph, but 6th gear will be more useable.<br>

The TnT, Tornado & RS all use the same front (and rear) sprockets, on my Tornado & RS I ran 15/43 ratio, heaps better.
 I actually used a 520 conversion, the rear sprockets are AFAM to suit Marchesini wheels and I ground the original
 front sprocket down from 7mm (525) to 6mm (520).</p>

Whats the stock Tornado RS tooth sizes, .... 
also doesnt going smaller on the front cause the chain to wear quicker??</p>

Stock gearing on the RS is the same as the Tornado... 16/41, except the RS has an alloy rear sprocket.<br>
A smaller front sprocket will accelerate chain wear, but so what? It will also wear the plastic chain buffer quicker,
 I don't think it makes a ton of difference to the wear rate.<br>

Stock sprockets on the TnT are 16/36 but our press bike runs 16/41.</p>

 Johnny O had provided advice on dropping to 15 on the front sprocket and going up to 43 on the rear.<br>
Which gives a final drive of 2.8666<br>
2nd gear at redline (11k5) is 160kph<br>

<p>Standard is 41 / 16 for final drive of 2.5625 (stock setup)<br>
2nd gear at redline (11k5) is 179kph (according to ducboyjr, 1/17/06)</p>

<p>41 / 15 = 2.7333<br>
2nd gear at redline (11k5) will be 168kph</p>

<p>43 / 16 = 2.6875<br>
2nd gear at redline (11k5) will be 171kph</p>

<b>NBB: if Rear / Front is an Integer</b>, and the front has a bad tooth, it will wear the chain unevenly, because it will
 always mate with a subset of the links, not every link.

<strong>If you change from 16/41 to 15/43</strong>, and use a standard 56 plate (112 roller) chain, you'll need to remove 4.5mm
 from the barrel of the adjuster lock nut. My locknuts ended up at 28mm long.
