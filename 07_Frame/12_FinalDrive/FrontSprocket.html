<P>Front Sprocket Alternatives - 14,15,16 tooth 525:-</p>

<p><strong>Direct replacement</strong> <br>
<ol>
<LI>AFAM (16 tooth) Part Number: 94900-16</LI>
<LI>PBR do a direct replacement as well, in 15 & 16 tooth. Part Numbers : 2129-15 & 2129-16 (If I read their document correctly)
 Try Red Racing Parts www.redracingparts.com<br>
(PBR do a range of rear sprockets as well - all sizes between 36 & 46 teeth. Part Number: 4456 -xx, where xx is the number of teeth)</LI>
<LI>Laurence, of Benelliforum fame, can supply the original part, but up to the present, has not had a source of suitable lock washers.
 Pierpaolo, also of the forum, has recently discovered that the Ducati lock washer, P/N 85110041A, fits the Benelli output shaft.
 In particular, it locks to the spline, which is good news for those who have sourced sprockets without the circular array of holes.</LI>
 <li><a href="http://www.biketorqueracing.co.uk/?i=191698" target="_blank">Bike Torque Racing p/n:94900-15</a> No lockwasher apparent.</li>

<p><strong>Modifiable replacement</strong> <br>
<ol>
<li>Ducati use a similar front sprocket on many models, including :-<br>
944 Sport Tourismo ST2, 916 Strada Biposto, 916 SPS Sport Production, 992 ST3, 996, 998, 999 .....<br>
Ducati Part Number 449-102-71A</li>
<li>JT Sprockets Part Number JTF740-14, JTF740-15, JTF740-16</li>
<li>AFAM Part Number 90-0563</li>
<li>"MV Augusta - front sprocket is the same across all models so F4 1000 or 750. The center offset was only off by 1 or
 2 mm. So I didn't bother to do any machining. Around $80 U.S. Dollar." (benmaw)</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>If you want to go to a 520 chain</strong><br>
<ol>
<LI>PBR p/n 2097 is a 15 tooth steel sprocket, without the circular array of holes. PBR 1031 is a 43 tooth alloy rear (rusty-pie 25 Mch 2012)</LI>
<LI>JTF737-15, Ducati part Number 449-100-71A, which suits the '90-'93 917 Paso Sports. It does need machining both sides.</LI>

<p>In Australia, Link International import JT Sprockets. Their Part Number for the JT740-15 is "41-D05-15". It is
 retailed by most bike shops, including Canberra Motorcycle Centre (15% Ulysses discount) and Joe's Motorcycles.</P>

<p>The boss is offset, and needs to be machined down by 7mm (to 1 mm) to fit, but otherwise it is a much cheaper alternative.
 One problem though, it is hard - harder than the Benelli sprocket - so a tungsten tool is required. High speed steel won't touch it,
 but tungsten slices through it like it was butter.</p>

<p>Works fine. Not a hint of loosening. A lot cheaper than the OEM was in 2006, heavier, but harder, and lasts
 longer.<br>
There are cheaper alternatives available now (10 years later in 2015). See above.
</p>

<p>NB: Chain Gang recommend changing the front sprocket half way through the life of the chain & rear.</p>
