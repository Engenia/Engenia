These are the same as used by the BMW F650.<br>
A little care is needed to ensure there is clearance between the finished bolt head and the speedo sensor. 
The counter-bore on the OEM is 2.0 mm, while the BDF one is between 1.65 & 1.70 mm, so the head will be higher. <br>
The price at Apr 2011 was US $60 + US $35 shipping</p>
