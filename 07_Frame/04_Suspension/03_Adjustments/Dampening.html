<p>You’ll be better able to adjust your suspension correctly if you first understand how it was designed
 to operate and can identify symptoms of incorrect operation.</p>

<P><center><STRONG>BASIC PRINCIPLES</P></center></STRONG>


<p>Preload and spring rate primarily affect how your suspension handles the big stuff, whereas dampening
 primarily affects how it handles the small stuff. But there is considerable overlap in who does what, so
 it’s a team effort. When they work together properly, you get both comfort and control over a wide range
 of riding conditions.</p>

<p>Compression Dampening works with the spring to resist the wheel’s upward movement during a bump. In both
 the front and the rear suspension, for example, it helps the spring resist bottoming on big bumps, sharp
 rocks or deep whoops.</p>

<p>Rebound Dampening works against the spring to resist the wheel’s downward movement after a bump. In the
 shock, for example, it keeps the rear spring from jamming the seat into your butt, and in the forks, keeps
 the front springs from pushing the bars into your face.</p>

<p>If they have not been adjusted to work together, the wheels bounce and slide rather than roll. And you
 get a lousy ride. Or crash and burn in the boonies. Too much compression dampening, for example, helps
 the spring too much, which produces a jarring, haphazard and uncomfortable ride over even the smallest
 rocks and bumps.</p>

<p>Too little compression dampening can also give you a "hard" ride if you have a "soft" spring
 -- especially if there is too much rebound dampening. The soft spring, and less-than-ideal compression
 dampening, allow the wheel to come up too much when it hits a bump, and the excessive rebound dampening
 keeps the wheel from returning to its "normal" position in time for the next bump. After a series of
 bumps, the suspension gets "stuck in a squat" with maybe an inch or two of travel.</p>

<p>This is packing, and shows its ugly face as harshness in the handlebars or side-to-side swapping of
 the rear wheel. Even with the correct spring.</p>

<p>Rebound dampening in the forks plays a major role in how well your bike corners. The compression of the
 springs during a turn "push" the wheel into the ground. The correct rebound dampening "holds" the
 spring’s rate of return so this "push" is maintained until the turn is completed. You front wheel
 develops good "cone effect" and your bike tracks through the turn smoothly and accurately.</p>

<p>Too little rebound dampening allows this "push" to get weak, then go away before the turn is complete.
 The wheel turns late or loses traction, and your bike turns wide or washes out. Too much dampening allows
 this "push" to be stronger and longer than necessary to complete the turn. The front wheel bites too
 deeply, and your bike turns early and inside.</p>

<p>Compared to your present settings, more dampening slows the wheel’s movement for a firmer ride,
 whereas less dampening speeds the wheel’s movement for a softer ride.</p>

<p>For both rebound and compression dampening, turn the clickers out (CCW) to decrease dampening and
 in (CW) to increase dampening.</p>

<p>***********</p>

<p>Even the most commonly accepted principles and rules of thumb should be tested in the real world of
 trial and error, revision and adjustment, so let’s take a ....</p>

<p><b>TEST RIDE</b></p>

<p><b>Shock Rebound</b></p>

<p>Ride through rocks, roots or bumps leading into and out of a corner. If the rear wheel hops when
 braking for the corner or accelerating out of it, soften the Rebound Dampening a few clicks and try again.</p>

<p>Ride over a log, ledge or rock. If the rear kicks up badly, stiffen the Rebound Dampening a few clicks.</p>

<p>Ride through some deep whoops on hard ground. If your bike doesn’t track straight and the rear wheel
 doesn’t extend to the bottom of each whoop before the next one, or swaps badly, soften the Rebound
 Dampening and try again. If that doesn’t help, stiffen the Compression Dampening a few clicks, and try
 again.</p>

<p><b>Shock Compression</b></p>

<p>Ride a trail with small rocks, roots and bumps. If the rear end feels harsh and bouncy, soften the
 Compression Dampening. If it wallows, you’re riding the spring -- add Compression Dampening.</p>

<p>Ride off your biggest jump. If your shock bottoms badly, add two clicks of Compression Dampening. If
 it still bottoms badly, and your bike is not equipped with a Hi-Speed adjuster, try a stiffer spring.</p>

<p><b>Fork Rebound</b></p>

<p>Ride a short, sweeping turn. If your bike resists the turn, understeers, drifts to the outside, or
 the tire loses steering traction and washes out, add Rebound Dampening. If it oversteers, turns too
 quickly to the inside, or the tire bites too hard and knifes into the ground, decrease the Rebound
 Dampening.</p>

<p><b>Fork Compression</b></p>

<p>Ride a trail with small rocks, roots and bumps. If the handlebars feel harsh, soften the Compression
 Dampening. If not, add Compression Dampening until they do feel harsh, then back off a click or two.</p>

<p><b><a name="AdjustmentTips">Adjustment Tips</a></b></p>

<p>Adjust the <a href="#RiderSag">Rider Sag</a> and check bike sag to ensure you’ve got the correct
 spring.<br>
Check the pressure in both tires, and bleed the air pressure in both forks.<br>
Use as little dampening as possible to get a "plush" ride, not a "soft" ride.<br>
Small or smooth bumps want more compression dampening than big or sharp ones.<br>
Hard trails want less dampening, and soft trails want more dampening<br>
But sand requires very stiff settings – don’t be surprised if you max CW your clickers.<br>
Use the Hi-Speed Adjuster for jumps, and the standard Compression Dampening adjuster for bumps.<br>
Improper riding technique can fool you into misadjusting your suspension.<br>
You can make the wheel hop if you lock the brake or pull the clutch in a turn.<br>
You can make your bike over or under steer with incorrect body position.</p>

<p>************</p>

<p>In the life of every problem, there is a time when it’s big enough to see but small enough to solve.
 So let’s take a look at a few solutions to some of the most common…</p>

<p><b>HANDLING PROBLEMS</b></p>

<p><b>Jarring</b> => harsh ride in the handlebars on relatively small but sharp bumps<br>
Decrease the Compression Dampening & the Rebound Dampening so wheel comes up and goes down faster<br>
Try a fork spring with a lower spring rate for a softer ride</p>

<p><b>Packing</b> => harsh ride in handlebars on larger bumps<br>
Increase the Compression Dampening in the forks to limit the compression<br>
Decrease the Rebound Dampening to help the wheel return more quickly<br>
Try stiffer fork springs</p>

<p><b>Headshake</b> => front wheel ocsillates side to side, especially in soft stuff<br>
Move forks lower in triple clamps to increase rake and straight-line stability<br>
Decrease the Rebound Dampening in forks so wheel rolls over rather than ploughs into ground<br>
Try stiffer front springs and softer rear spring to move center of gravity rearward</p>

<p><b>Oversteers</b> => bike turns too quickly, goes inside the turn, front wheel knifes<br>
Move forks lower in the triple clamps to increase rake, slow down turning<br>
Decrease the Rebound Dampening on both forks to slow down the turning<br>
Install stiffer fork spring so wheel won’t sink in and bite too much</p>

<p><b>Understeers</b> => bike turns too slowly, drifts wide -- front wheel pushes, washes out<br>
Move forks higher in triple clamps to decrease rake and speed up turning<br>
Increase the Rebound Dampening on both forks to increase "cone effect" and speed up turning<br>
Bleed air pressure in both forks to stop the front wheel from pushing<br>
Try softer fork springs so wheel bites rather than pushes the ground</p>

<p><b>Kickup</b> => rear wheel hops straight up, seat pops you in the butt<br>
Increase the Rebound Dampening to slow down wheel’s return after hitting a bump</p>

<p><b>Swapping</b> => rear wheel hops side to side in hard to loamy whoops<br>
Increase the Compression Dampening, and/or decrease the Rebound Dampening to eliminate packing</p>

<p><b>Braking Hop</b> => rear wheel hops excessively when braking for bumps or a corner<br>
Decrease shock’s Rebound Dampening to help wheel follow the bumps more quickly</p>
<p><b>Acceleration Hop</b> => rear wheel hops badly on rough ground during acceleration<br>
Decrease the Rebound Dampening to help wheel follow the bumps more quickly<br>
If that doesn’t lessen the kickup, decrease the shock’s Compression Dampening</p>

<p><b>Acceleration Spin</b> => the rear wheel loses traction under heavy acceleration<br>
Increase the Rebound Dampening to improve rear wheel "squat"</p>

<p><b><a name="RiderSag">Definition: Suspension Sag</a></b><br>
Sag indicates the measurable distance the rear suspension compresses from weight, spring rate, and
 spring pre-load. There are two types of sag.</p>

<p><b>Race sag (Rider sag)</b>: The amount the rear suspension compresses under the weight of the bike and rider.</p>

<p><b>Static sag (Free sag)</b>: The amount the rear suspension compresses under the weight of the bike alone
 (no rider).</p>
