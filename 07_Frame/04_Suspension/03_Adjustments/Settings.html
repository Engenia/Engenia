Forks:<br>
1. The forks springs are miles too soft, wind the preload adjusters all the way down too full hard.<br>
2. Screw the compression adjusters (on the bottom of the forks) all the way in, then back them out 1/4 turn.<br>
3. Rebound adjusters set at full soft, all the way out.<br>

Rear:<br>
1. I found exactly as the manual say's was best for both damping adjusters.<br>
2. spring preload: set it with about 10mm of unladen sag.
