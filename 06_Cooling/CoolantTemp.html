Can anyone tell me if the temperature gauge on the Tornado is even vaguely accurate? In the current warm weather
 (UK 28 deg C) mine runs at around 95 Deg travelling at 50mph or more but if I get any traffic for a few minutes
 it’s straight up into the end of the red or even off the gauge!</p>

Do you mean engine water temp or the ambient one, sounds like you just need to do the coolant bleed, I'm in West
 OZ and have never had a problem in 40 C weather.</p>

Tornado's are supposed to run at 95, bottom of the red zone on the temp gauge.<br>
Make sure you have the correct radiator cap and that the system is bled properly and that there is no coolant
 in the expansion tank when cold.<br>
With that done, you will not have any problems.</p>

Why 'no coolant in expansion when cold'? The handbook states "check the level when cold, with bike upright,
 level between min and max marks"?</p>

Answer to marcho's last question can be found there as well.</p>
