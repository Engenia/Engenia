<p>The cylinder head core plug from a Ducati 748/916/996/998/ST2 and ST4 will fit the Benelli Tornado
 and costs about 70p. In Australia it will cost about $5.00. If you spin the right story, Ducati will
 give it to you for nicks!<br>

Ducati Part Number 87310011A

<p>Actually, as Baz (in Jindy) found out, the core plug is a standard 16mm brass type, available at just
 about any automotive store. Baz picked his up from Repco (remember the Repco Brabham?) for $1.
