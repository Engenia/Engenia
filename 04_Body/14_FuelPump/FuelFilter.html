(4 Jun 2007)</center></P>

<P>
The fuel filter resides inside the tank, in an assembly which includes the fuel pump and
gauge sender unit.
</P>

<P>
The original part is Fiaam FT5452, which is also used by the Aprillia Futura. Part # 8102971.
 It is 55mm dia (max) & has a 70mm body length.
</p>
<p>
(from the Fiaam website)<br>
"The components of injection systems are much more sensitive to contamination than carburettor
 systems. Therefore these systems always have a fuel filter, either an in-tank or an in-line
 filter. The fuel pump, usually mounted in the fuel tank, aspirates the fuel in the tank and
 pumps it via the filter element to the injectors. The filter element is finer than that
 required by a carburettor system: 5 to 7 microns. The element is mounted in a metal/plastic
 (conductive) housing and also absorbs the water in the fuel."

Alternatives are:- <br>
Ryco Z200<br>
Baldwin BF1049

The filter uses 8mm hose. The inlet hose is 10mm outside dia, and the outlet hose is 15mm outside dia.
 If replacing the FIAMM filter with one of the alternatives above, the diameter is slightly larger &
 body length a little longer. The body joins at the delivery end, which tends to make it stick out
 at an angle, which would make it impossible to slip back into the tank. To fix this, the outlet tube
 must be increased to 80mm long, to allow a bend (see pics below). So you'll need 80mm of 8mm high
 pressure fuel hose, and 3 hose clamps to suit 10 - 15 mm hose.

As an aside, I'll swear that the fuel pump / filter / gauge unit was installed
 incorrectly at the factory. I marked it's orientation before I dismantled it.
 On re-assembly, it leaked. On closer inspection, I noticed an indentation / tag
 that was meant to set the correct orientation. When I used this, it sealed fine.
