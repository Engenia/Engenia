<P><center><STRONG>Carbon Fibre Rack</STRONG></center></P>
<P>This rack, developed in 2008/9, mounts onto the bike in a similar manner to the original aluminium one,
 in place of the pillion seat. It is a moulded in carbon fibre composite, which makes it both lighter and stronger, and
  aesthetically more pleasing. The first 2 took 13 hours each to manufacture, using moulds built up over many weeks.</P>

<P>The top 2 pictures show the Carbon Fibre Rack mounted on Nell, with tie-point bobbins attached. The bobbins
 are sized to fit 2 standard "octopus" strap hooks, side by side.<br>
The bottom 2 pictures show the CF Rack itself from above & below. The side of the rack has 4x M6 (aviation) nutplates glued
internally, which are used to add accessories, such as tiedown bobbins, or a pack-base (see below). A larger side rack system
 is also envisaged, similar to the original 2005 rack below. The base of the rack shows it's mounting lugs, locking pin, and
  tiedown bobbins.

<P><b><i>Oxford Tailpack Mounting Accessory</i></b><br>
The 4 Bobbin tiepoints are removed, to enable fitment of a pack base. This can be used to attach a top-box. The following
 shows it used with an Oxford (OF520) tailpack, called a Humpback. This pack has been superceded, however, it's successor,
 is very similar, and can be attached in the same manner.<br>
 The <a href="http://www.oxford-shop.co.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford Tailpack</a> consists of a pack and a base, to
  which it is zipped. In the case below, the base is an OF547, which has had it's straps removed, then sandwiched between
  2 sheets of black HDPE, screwed together and then to a Carbon Fibre Pack Base.</P>

<P>The PackBase is fixed to the CFR, via the 4x M6 nutplates mentioned above, and the tailpack zips to it.
 This makes for easy removal of the tailpack, while the Carbon Fibre Rack & accessory remains securely fixed
  to the bike. The standard M6 screws have stainless steel allen heads. The nutplates are an interference fit,
  which will not shake free, and do require an allen key to remove. For added security, these screws could be
  replaced with <a href="http://brycefastener.com/" target="_blank">tamperproof type heads.</a>

 of scuffing the Carbon Fibre Rack ribs.

<P><b><i>Ventura Pack Mounting Accessory</i></b><br>
The 4 Bobbin tie-points are removed, to enable fitment of a steel tube rail. The rail is shaped to accept a
Ventura bag.<br>
 The <a href="http://www.ventura-bike.com/products/bikepack/p0656.aspx" target="_blank">Ventura Euro-Rally</a> pack
  expands from 44 to 56 litres and slips into position in seconds.<br>
This system was tested in June 2010, on a trip from Canberra to Brisbane, on roads that ranged from the sublime (Bylong Valley & Mt Lindsay)
 to "I'm never going to get through this without dropping it" (a wet clay Comboyne Rd). Very little motorway was used, and the system came though it
 with flying colours.<br />
 Since 2010, it's been used for thousands of kilometres including several trips to the Philip Island racetrack after giving up marshalling. It
 has performed flawlessly. The Ventura bag doesn't have the capacity or the low centre of gravity of the original aluminium rack and bespoke
 bag but it's easier to pack, attach and remove. It's also waterproof.</P>
