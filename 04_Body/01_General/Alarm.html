The loom has a plug inside the right hand side of the front upper fairing, that the Gemel (META) E587T
 will plug into, with no additional wiring....(<i>Mikethmitch, 21 Sep 2005</i>)<br>
I (<i>laurencewhite, 21 Sep 2005</i>) also fitted an additional unit that sends a message to my Mobile phone
 if the bike is disturbed,  which gets round the limited range of a Pager unit. You can also trace where
 the bike is on the Web, if it does happen to get nicked. How cool is that?<br>
