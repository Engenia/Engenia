<P><center><STRONG>How to Make the Arduous Task of Removing The Tank a LOT Easier</STRONG><br>22 Dec 2007
</center></P>

<P>I got sick and tired of struggling with the fuel line every time I wanted to remove the tank. Generally it
 was a 2 man operation. It got harder when the tank tabs broke off, and the Benelli tool (#R180100143000)
 would no longer work. I had to sacrifice a pair of long nose pliers to make a tool that would expand the
 retaining clips in the "rapid unhooking petrol tube" (Benelli's words - see pg 120 in the Tre Manual), but
 these were just as difficult to use as the original one.</p>

<p>The new method for removing the tank involves lifting it up and forward (protect the top triple clamp with
 a thick clean rag), sitting it on the frame, disconnecting the hoses and wiring, and removing it. Next to no
 fuel spillage, and a one man operation taking about 2 minutes. Not much different to before, but the cursing and
 swearing part has been removed from the procedure, along with some time.</p>

<p>The magic part is the addition of a Quick Release fuel line connector. It is sold by Touratech in
 <a href="http://www.touratech.de/" target="_blank">Germany</a>,
 <a href="http://touratech-usa.com/shop/search_sku.lasso?SKU=100-0106&=Find%2BPart%20" target="_blank">USA</a>
 & now <a href="mailto:info@touratech.com.au">Australia</a>.
 The one I used is 8mm & seals the tank hose when it disconnects. The delivery side is open, which means some
 fuel will escape onto the garage floor, but within acceptable limits.</p>
<p>The part number is 01-100-0106-0. It cost me AUD64.90, including shipping and taxes - it would have been
 cheaper to get it direct from Germany, but they insisted on dealing through their Australian distributer.
 It's pictured below.</p>

<p>The hose itself is very stiff. The internal diameter is 6 mm, so it must be expanded before fitting the barb.
 I forced an 8mm ball ended Allen (hex) key, into the core to expand it. The length of the expanded section must be
 enough to allow the barb to slide in full length. If not, the barb is not strong enough to complete the job. It will
 remain too short.<br>
A better tool would be a 9mm ball fitted to the end of a 7mm rod. This would allow the expanded depth to be reached
 more easily. As I only had 2 to do, I didn't bother making the tool.</p>

<p> Update: <i>Laurencewhite - Benelliforum</i>, reckons that Touratech now sell a 6mm version of the connector. Part
 number 01-100-0100-0. Buy it
 <a href="http://www.touratech.com/shops/008/product_info.php?products_id=3974" target="_blank">from the Touratech
 website</a>
</p>

<p>The fuel line is shaped like an 'S' - I placed the connector at the inflection point.</p>

<p>Make sure you slide on the clamps before fitting the barb. If you want to get it off again, you'll have to
 cut the fuel line. The barbs work well.</p>

<p>I also heated the tank hose (right picture) in boiling water, and made the curve tighter.</p>
<p>Nick [nique from the Benelliforum] has also done this mod. He sourced the same (Motrax) fuel coupling from
