<p><center><b>How it came into being</b><br></center>
Richard Crispin originally approached and persuaded GCC to do the job. They apparently weren't that
 keen to do it, so accolades to Deke for his persistance. It was his tank that was used to
create the mould. The coloured lettering (red, green and silver) was done by another outside source, and
 GCC incorporated it into the mould. He paid a premium for the work, out of his own pocket, but as an act
 of goodwill, he handed it over to Libby (the importer). Given that it was his work, and nothing to do
 with Benelli, or the Australian importer, he can't see any reason why GCC can't do more protectors with
 the coloured lettering (and neither can the editor). <br>
Johnny O didn't take it any further, as it was going to cost them money, so he gave away the remaining
 stock that GCC made up. Not sure how many they did in the end.
