Fired up the red Tornado on the weekend and noticed a bit of a noise from the alternator area at idle. Had a bit
 of time up my sleeve so I pulled it off and found the pulley on the alternator was loose, had about 6mm end
 float due to a loose pulley nut. Workshop manual has no end float measurements that I could see, so I tightened
 it up and reinstalled... Heaps quieter now. Might check the silver bike's alternator this weekend. Has anyone
 been here before?

JohnnyO can confirm this, but I seem to remember that this is one of the failure modes of the 2nd gear on the
 clutch basket. If the alternator gear is loose, the clutch basket gear wears, and eventually fails. It's
 documented <a href="../08_Clutch/ClutchGearFailure.html">here</a>. This happened to dean100yz
 earlier this year.<br>
I believe there was a recall on this. The Aussie frame Numbers under recall can be found
 <a href="../08_Clutch/AussieRecal.html">here</a><br>
Check the clutch basket gear as well.</p>

Yep that's right, all the early Tornado's that came to Australia were supposed to have a lock washer fitted to
 the generator coupling retaining bolt by the selling dealer, Adrian at Moto Heaven should know about that, he
 was at Cruiz Motorcycles when I sent the lockwasher kits to all the dealers.<br>

If I was you, I'd be removing the clutch basket and inspecting the mid size gear on the back of it; the loose
 generator bolt will cause abnormal wear on the gear PLUS you should check the thickness (width) of the gear
 as some early models had a narrow gear that can fly apart.</p>
