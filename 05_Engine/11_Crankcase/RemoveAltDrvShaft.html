		<p><center><strong>Alternator Drive Shaft Removal Procedure</strong></center></p>
		<ol>
		<li>Remove the alternator - follow the workshop manual Sect 9.8 (pg 326)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>O-ring seal is 2.4 mm section 77 mm ID (accepting bore is 81 mm ID)</li>
				<li>Can re-use old o-ring, if not damaged, but 10 mm must be removed (cleanly & square), and re-attached with superglue. If you don't do this,
				 it will not fit snugly in the groove, and will be cut by the accepting bore when the alternator is re-fitted. It will take a day or so to discover the
				 oil leak - it's very slow.</li>
				<li>When refitting the alternator, hold the rubber couplings in place with a dab of PVA glue</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Remove the alternator drive coupling:-</li>

			</tr>
		</table>
			<ol>
				<li>Open up the lockwasher, to gain access to the coupling bolt. The tags on the lockwasher break off in time, so it should be replaced with a Belville washer.</li>
				<li>Undo the coupling bolt using a rattle (impact) gun. If the shaft spins, select 6th gear, apply the rear brake and try again. If you don't have access to a rattle
				gun, the job may prove to be difficult. You may need to make a tool to grip the clutch using 3 of the 6 thrust plate screws</li>
				<li>DON'T remove the shaft just yet!</li>
			</ol> 
		<li>Remove the clutch - follow the workshop manual Sect 5.8.3 (pg 151) - it's comprehensive.<br>
			<ul>
				<li>The clutch cover centering screws should be removed last, or they may be difficult to undo due to the pressure of the surrounding screws</li>
				<li>Use a magnet to remove the ball bearing at the end of the pushrod</li>
				<li>The clutch fixing nut is 36 mm A/F</li>
				<li>Check the roller bearings. If they are slip fit (early clutch), the bearing number is KT40x47x18</li>
				<li>Check the thrust bearing. It's a standard cage bearing, not a thrust bearing, so it may not last that long (50,000 kms ?)</li>
				<li>Check & record the manufacture date. It's cast into the inside of the aluminium housing.</li>
				<li>Check the movement in the shock springs on the back. 2 may well be loose. Any more than a 5mm gap is getting a bit excessive,
				 and the source of much of the engine's rattles at idle. The springs can also wear their way through the back of the basket.
				 No gap is better - which is how the later models are made.</li>
				<li>When re-assembling the clutch plates, install the last plate in the offset position, as shown in the manual picture, but not mentioned.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>Remove the alternator drive shaft :-</li>

			</table>
			
			<ol>
				<li>If the Z25 gear is fixed to the shaft with loctite, have an assistant hold a 18-19 mm ID tube over the shaft end, to support the gear, and a
				heavy weight at the other end of the tube. Using a brass drift on the bolt side of the shaft, shock the glue free by striking the drift with a hammer.</li>
				<li>Follow the shaft through with a 13 mm od rod. This will capture the one way clutch, as it slides off the shaft. If you don't, the clutch will drop into
				the gearbox.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Alternator shaft re-assembly :-</li>
			<ul>
				<li>M10 bolt torque is 50 Nm. (pg 204, Sect 5.11.14)</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
