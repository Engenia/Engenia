<p>Although the Tornado gearbox has been bullet proof, the same can not be said of the selector mechanism.
 There have been a couple of reports of it not allowing any selection at all.</p>

<p>The problems I am aware of are:-<br>
1. The pin that centralises the return spring has worked loose & fallen out.<br>
(easy to fix - deform the pin & tap it back in place)<br>
2. Broken return spring - which has just happened to me, at 43,000km.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I had the wire from an old mattress lying around that just about fit the bill. The spring
constant was a bit lower, but, when bent into the required shape, seemed to work ok. I've ordered another,
 just in case.</p>

<p>A drawing of the spring follows, just in case anyone else needs it.</p>
