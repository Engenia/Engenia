<P><center><STRONG>False Neutral</STRONG><br>(02 Dec 2007)</center></P>

<P>As difficult as it is to select neutral, you may find one inadvertantly between 2nd & 3rd</p>

<p>I've found it a couple of times. Scared the crap out of me once!<br>
<i>dekenai - Benelliforum - </i>found it at Lukey Heights, just before he ran off into the kitty litter!
 His Tre is now a permanent track bike, I believe.<br>
<i>TorndadoTre - Benelliforum - </i>found it once near Brighton<br>
<i>KurtP - Benelliforum - </i>has found half a dozen times</p>

<p>Solution? Make your shifts positive, back down the box.</p>
