Default Discovery! Why Some (And Mine) Benelli's May Be Burning Oil/Blowing Blue Smoke

Been awhile since I posted on my issues with blue smoke clouds when running and oil getting past the valve guides, pooling up on the backsides of a couple intake valves (this on a new bike). Thought it was bad seals, or excessive valve stem to guide clearance. But after a run, I parked her, removed the tank and airbox cover, and with a light I periodically (over a few hours time) looked down the throttle bodies and discovered exactly where the oil was coming from. It was not coming from the valve stem/guide bore area......it is seeping BETWEEN THE HEAD AND VALVE GUIDE!...on two intakes.

I never thought about this as a possibility (I pretty much forgot this) yet in years past I've known about it occuring on some built stroker Harleys ......especially on custom ported heads with new guides being installed needing some sealant, before driving them in, to prevent leaks. Much research tells me that new guides should have sealant prior to installing, and definately on aluminum heads.

Short of a crack (extremely doubtful, and definately not on two guide bores)
I have a hunch Benelli does'nt apply sealant on the guides before installing them. And we know there are a few owners past/present who had the same type thing, and could never get it fixed. Replacing seals, guides, etc and it still smoked.

I know what the case is on my 07 TNT, maybe it applies to others?
