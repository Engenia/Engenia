After a couple of broken clutch cables in short succession, Nell was converted to hydraulic actuation
using an Evoluzione Cyclesports slave cylinder and a 2003 Ducati ST4S master cylinder (13mm).<br>
Unfortunately, Evoluzione Cycle sports subsequently closed up shop, so their slave cylinder is no longer available.
</p>

<p>
The new clutch lever was supplied by ASV Inventions, p/n: CRC552<br>
This matches the ASV brake lever p/n: BRC555

<p><h4>Why do it?</h4>(28 Jun 2021)<br />
There's been some <A href="https://www.benelliforum.com/threads/hydraulic-clutch-conversion-for-tnt.31381" target="_blank">discussion on the Forum about a Hydraulic
 clutch conversion using Maniac's kit</A>
 which as per usual was high jacked to become a general discussion on why you would want to do it at all. Here's my take on it:-</p>
<p>
 If done right, you should:-
 <ol>
	<li>be able to find neutral at rest</li>
	<li>end up with a lighter clutch</li>
	<li>never break a cable again (and in my case, get stuck on the wrong side of Mount Kosciuszko and have to ride 300 km through the mountains with a fuel stop before I could fix it.)</li>
 </ol>
Bear in mind though, I'm talking about a Tornado, not a TNT or TreK.

<td><img src="Dash-TNT.jpg" alt="TNT Cockpit" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is the Tornado cockpit. The clutch cable makes a right angle bend at the lever, which adds friction to the cable even when new,
 but as the inner liner wears, friction steadily increases, until the liner no longer "lubricates" the cable. Then it gets really bad.</td>
<td>This is the TNT cockpit. The cable clutch has a gentle bend from the lever. It is much closer to a straight pull and so has nowhere
 near the friction of the Tornado and as a result, will last vastly longer and require a much lower pull force.</td>
</tr>

<p>
If I had a TNT or TreK I probably wouldn't bother with a hydraulic conversion, although point 3. above is a compelling argument. My TR650 Husky layout is similar to the TNT and I'm more than happy with it.
 The RXV is also similar, but it has a 20 kg pull, more than twice that of the Tornado. I'll be looking into ways to reduce that.
</p>
<p>Nell's cable broke the second time in 2008 at 45,000 km, and it was the last straw! It did give me notice of impending disaster. It felt springy then broke a couple of uses later. When it failed the 
first time, 6 months earlier, it gave me no advanced warning at all. I pulled the clutch in approaching a set of lights, and nothing. I had to think very quick and take a slipway left. Not something
I wish on anyone.<br />
At that time, I couldn't find neutral at a stand still. That changed as soon as I installed the hydraulic system, so obviously it gave me more lift than the cable did, the way it was set.
 Chances are, if I'd adjusted the cable system perfectly, neutral would have been easier to find, but to do that requires two adjustments, one at the lever, the other at the clutch.
 With a hydraulic system, you only have one - the amount of fluid in the system. It makes little difference where the clutch adjuster is set, as the fluid compensates.
 The only thing to worry about is how far out that adjuster is set. Too far and it will touch the clutch cover, or worse, lift the top plate clear of the basket.<br />
Of course, lift is all dependant on master/slave ratios.<br />
The last 100,000 odd km with the hydraulic clutch have been trouble free. If I had stuck with the cable, I would be on my third and waiting for it to break.
No doubt the bike would have been out of commission for months waiting for them to arrive, because you can't simply replace the inner and expect the problem to be solved - as I found in 2008.
</p>
<p><h4>So what is needed in a hydraulic system?</h4>
That depends on on what you are looking for. If you want a lighter clutch, you will need a larger ratio from lever to clutch lift, implying less lift and more lever movement.
If you want to find neutral more easily, the opposite is the case. You'll need more lift for less lever movement, ie. a smaller ratio.<br />
A table of some existing clutch actuating systems follows:-

Houlster's system would have the lightest clutch, while Nell's would be the heaviest, all other things being equal.<br />
Jane has an RS (#298) which has stronger clutch springs. It also had a higher clutch stack, which combined for a heavier clutch than Nell, until I reduced the stack to nearer the minimum,
 but even with only a 2.7 mm lift, neutral was easily found.<br />
The cable system looks good, until cable drag is introduced. Then there is the added setup complexity.
</p>
<p>Just a couple of words on the cable numbers before this is wrapped up.<br />
If you measure all of the lever lengths in the cable system, they can simply be "called" bore diameters, but they must be swapped. It's a close approximation for narrow angles when the pull is tangential,
 but gets worse the greater the angle you pull the lever through.</br>
The clutch command lever is 26.27 mm from centre to centre. The lever that pushes the clutch "pin" can move it 5.95 mm max.<br />
These numbers are academic. Of greatest interest is the final ratio from lever to plate lift, which in the case of the cable, is 43 / 3.1 = 13.9
</p>
<p><h4>Jane's Hydraulic Conversion</h4>
As already stated, the master is a Brembo PR15 and the slave is off a 2007 Aprilia RSV.<br />

</table>
<h5>One final point</h5>
There is a plunger pin in each master that connects from the lever to the master cylinder piston. Depending on where the lever sits when mounted,
 the length of the pin may need adjustment in order to minimize "play". Too much play reduces the available lift, too little and the clutch will slip.
