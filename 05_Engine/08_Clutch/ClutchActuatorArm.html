<P>What about this actuator arm stuff?<br>
 How can I check which version is on my bike?<br>
 How can I easily spot the difference?<br>
 Any pictures anyone?</P>

<p>The clutch actuating arm sits just in front of the front sprocket.<br>
The original one was made of alloy and the modified one is made of steel, and is black in colour.</p>
