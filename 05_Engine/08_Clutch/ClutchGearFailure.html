<P><center><STRONG>Rattly Right Side leads to Clutch Gear Failure</STRONG><br>(26 Oct 2009)</center></P>
<p><font size="+2">The Symptom</font></p>
<P>This one is nasty. It happened to dean100yz, from the Benelliforum. He posted the following on the 26 April 2006.
 If the right side of the engine starts to rattle more than usual - STOP. You'll be glad you did.</p>

<p><center>(before - Ed.)</center></P>

<p> Hey all. I've been clocking up some miles recently and have noticed something. When I start the bike up from
 cold the right side (assuming the clutch basket) rattles or at least I think thats what it is. I can only describe
 it as the sound of a duc dry clutch, only not as loud. Once it warms up the noise goes a bit and theres been no
 loss in power, surges or funny clutch action. However, speaking to a local Benelli dealer, they said its probably
 the clutch basket and they're prone for going. Has anyone else suffered a problem like this or has similar
 symptoms?? I'm a little worried on riding until I know for sure, but I've booked to go Isle of Man in June and
 Silverstone end of May :\</p>

<p><center>(after - Ed.)</center></P>

<p>Ah seems the problem was a little worse than I first thought. Something to do with the clutch. Was stuck 70
 miles from home today...oh the joy. Still my fault should have had it checked.</p>

<p><center>(a little later - Ed.)</center></P>

<p>I've stripped her of all her clothes today including sump, clutch cover etc. The sump plug is magnetic and
 picked up a good majority of the damaged parts - it was full of metal and swarf.<br>
If anyone develops a loud rattling right side get it repaired - it'll last about 1000 miles tops.<br>
There are a few other symptoms as well as the rattling. The bike was struggling to engage 1st when in neutral. Also
 the bike can lurch forward even when the clutch is in. I didn't get these, but after speaking to a Benelli guru he
 said they can also happen.</p>

<p><center>(later still - Ed.)</center></P>

<p>I'm 90% through what bits I think broke on the bike. I'm finishing it off tonight. So far the main bit was on
 pg 155/6 of the workshop manual, section 5.8.7/8 I think its called the primary clutch bell unit. There's 3 gears
 running on the inside of this (the other side holds the clutch plates). The centre gear has ripped itself to
 pieces - dean100yz</p>

<p><font size="+2">The Cause</font></p>
<p>This is not actually, a clutch fault. It is caused by the M10 x 1.25 x 25 bolt at the end of the alternator
	drive shaft coming loose. This bolt holds the alternator drive dog in place, which in turn keeps the shaft and Z25
	gear from floating towards the clutch primary gear. If it is allowed to move too far, the Z25 & intermediate gears
	will not engage sufficiently, and the intermediate gear teeth will wear away, as you can see by the picture below.
	The Z25 (Control) gear will also suffer as a result. (see pic below)
</p>
<p><font size="+2">The Solution</font></p>
<p>Benelli originally Loctited the M10 bolt in place, but thermal cycling weakend the bond, allowing the bolt to
	unscrew.<br>
	They then produced a rather special lock washer to hold the M10 bolt in place. You can see this in the sepia toned
	picture, 3 pics below. Unfortunately, thermal cycling could also break the tabs off this washer, allowing the M10
	bolt to unscrew<br>
	Around 2007 / 8, the factory replaced the lock washer, with a belville washer - at least on the TNT. A belville
	washer is able to retain pressure on the M10 bolt, despite thermal dimension changes, and this has been a
	successful solution.

<p>Suffice to say, you don't want this to happen, so do something! If your frame number is 297 or lower, check it.</p>

<p>All the early Tornado's (up to frame 297) that came to Australia were supposed to have the lock washer fitted to the
 alternator coupling retaining bolt, by the selling dealer. Lock washer kits were sent to all of the dealers. Frame
 numbers above 297 should have been delivered with the lock washer installed at the factory, but it's worth checking
 it, just for peace of mind.</p>

	<LI>The original problem. It just wasn't made thick enough, and simply fell apart.
	</LI>
	<li>The intermediate gear wasn't strong enough. It developed cracks from the lightening
 holes to the gear teeth. This was fixed by increasing its width.

The 2003 Surflex Clutch has some spurious issues. Mine has done nearly 70,000 km, without any issues, but others
 haven't been quite so fortunate. Generally, the clutch rattles, to varying degrees. If it approaches the sound of a
 Ducati dry clutch, expect problems.<br>
		The rattles are produced by the cush drive springs. In the 2007 model, the springs are controlled much
		more closely, and so, are relatively quiet. The 2003 model allowed the springs to move radially and
		tangentially. Together, this wore the clutch basket base, sometimes clear through. If the tangential
		movement approached 10 mm, at the basket / primary gear interface (where movement IS allowed), then
		the drive can be erratic at low revs.

Surflex appear to have solved all of these problems, in their 2007 model clutch.<br>
When replacing a clutch, it is best to insist on the latest clutch. Benelli may still hold old stock, so beware.

<strong>How can you tell if you have the upgraded clutch basket?</strong><br>
JohnnyO says, that:-<br>
 - it has the letter 'J' stamped on the middle gear.<br>
 - the old thin gear is 6mm wide, the new improved clutch basket has an 8mm wide gear fitted.<br>
If you need to get one, it has the same part number as the old one.</p>
