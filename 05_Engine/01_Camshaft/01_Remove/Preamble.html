<P><center><STRONG>Tornado 903 Camchain Replacement Procedure</STRONG><br>(25 Jun 2011)</center></P>
<P><font size="+1"><b>Introduction</b></font><br>
Benelli states that the cam chain must be replaced at 25,000 km intervals (40,000 for the TNT Sport). The moving guide is to be replaced at the same time.<br>
At 25,500 km my first chain had worn by 0.5mm over 272mm, which is an elongation of
 0.2%.<br>
A broken chain has been measured at 3mm over the same number of plates, which is an
 elongation of 1.1%. This chain was definitely worn out.<br>
Some authorities recommend a maximum elongation of 1% for an automotive cam chain. I
 suspect that they are referring to low reving engines. Clearly you don't want to get
 anywhere near this value, for fear of breakage. The ONLY way to track this, from new,
 without opening the engine up, is to
 <a href="../04_Tensioner/Tensioner.html#TensionerDepth">measure the camchain tensioner depth.</a><br>

<center><strong>So how far has yours worn?</strong></center><br>
As an indication, my engine has rarely been to 10,000 rpm, and never hit the limiter.
 It spends most of it's time at 5 - 6,000 rpm. It's never been on the track. In short,
 it's had an easy life so far, and at 25,000 km, the cam chain is, what I would consider
 to be, 1/2 worn out.<br>
The tensioner still had 1mm of spring movement at 25,000km.<br>
</p>

<center><strong>A brief note on the manual</strong></center><br>
The manual describes adjustable cam timing. Rusty Russ, from the Benelliforum, reckons
 that all LE's and the first 155 Tre900's are adjustable. Mine certainly is not, and
 this confused me for a while, when changing the chain.

<P><font size="+1"><b>Pre-requisites to Removal</b></font><br>
1. One new cam chain.<br>
2. One new movable cam chain guide.<br>
3. 3.5 litres of fresh oil.<br>
4. One oil filter.<br>
5. One new tappet cover gasket - if you're careful, you can re-use the existing one.<br>
6. One new clutch cover gasket - if you're careful, you can re-use the existing one.<br>
7. Torsion wrench for 26 Nm<br>
8. Torsion wrench for 13 Nm<br>
9. Gasket sealant that won't set hard.<br>
10. Thread lock - Loctite 243, or equivalent.<br>
11. 3 new spark plugs, with caps attached.<br>
12. 24mm open end wrench to rotate the camshafts</p>

<p><strong>A word of warning.</strong><br>
Using the wrench, rotate the camshafts ANTI-CLOCKWISE only! To rotate clockwise, use a special tool on the clutch pressure spring caps, or select 6th gear, and rotate the rear wheel FORWARD. You don't want to put undue pressure on the cam chain tensioner by rotating the engine backwards. There should always be a straight pull on the cam chain from the crankshaft sprocket to the exhaust camshaft then to the inlet camshaft. Never from the crankshaft to the inlet camshaft.<br>
You definitely don't want to use the crankshaft phonic bolt to rotate the crankshaft. It's not that strong.</p>
