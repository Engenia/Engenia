<p><font size="+1"><b>Cap Studs</b></font><br />
If your cap bolt threads are stripped, or in danger of becoming so, all is not lost. The head can be restored
 by installing M6 x 1.0 3D helicoils. These are 18 mm long.<br />
 You'll need to drill out the existing thread with a 6.20 mm drill to the full 22 mm depth for the 12 cam cap holes.<br />
When installing the helicoil, apply a light coating of Loctite 262 to the outside of the coil. Once installed, let
  it set for 3 hours at 22C before washing with isopropyl alcohol to remove any residual Loctite.<br />
The helicoil should be at least a quarter turn below the top of the hole. To be sure, mark the start
  of the thread before installing the coil and finish a quarter turn beyond it. If you are paranoid, positively lock the coil in place by
  peening the aluminium thread over to capture the top of the coil using a fine punch. (I didn't)<br />
The cap studs should be 49.5 mm long and at least R8.8. R10.9 is better, but much more expensive, R10.9 rod should NOT be plated
  due to corrosion issues. Threaded rod is fine if you can't find proper studs. Use Loctite 222 and torque to ~6 Nm by bottoming
  the stud. Let it cure for 3 hours at 22C.<br />
Use Class 8 nuts, hardened washers and lubricate the threads. Torque to 10 Nm if R8.8 studs, or 13 Nm if R10.9.
  I tried 13 Nm on a test R8.8 bolt & nut, and both threads were marked up, so best stick to the recommended 10 Nm.

<p><font size="+1"><b>Bridge Studs</b></font><br />
The 4 cam bridge holes are 30 mm deep.<br />
The stud length is 66 - 67 mm.<br />
I haven't installed studs for the bridge because I wasn't sure if there would be enough clearance to the frame to remove the bridge
 with the engine in place. Now, with the engine installed, I have measured the clearance from a parallel line across the top of the
 cap bolts to the frame as > 70 mm, and the bridge would only have to be lifted 37 mm (67-30) to remove it from the studs, so there
 is no cause for concern.

<p><font size="+1"><b>Torque Settings</b></font><br />
Torque values are generally specified dry, but the workshop manual (MF10) in section 2.5.1 "General Bolt Torque" specifically states
 that "Unless otherwise specified, the bolts are considered with greased thread ..". Greased, a.k.a. lubricated, means that oil,
 thread sealant or thread lock has been applied. Lubrication increases the bolt tension to 4/3 over that of a dry thread 
The cam cap bolt torques are given as 6 Nm then 12 Nm.
The function that relates torque applied (T) and the resulting tension force (F) in a bolt (assuming nuts
and bolts with rolled threads and industry standard thread pitch and flank angle) has been determined to be
as follows:</P>
