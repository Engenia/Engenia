24 Feb: measurement may have been in error (I hope), although 1 notch is about 1mm, which may put the 28 Oct
 measurement in error.<br>
6 July: no movement in the last 11,510 km is a worry. The chain is due to be replaced in the next 700 - 1000 km
 so I'll inspect it before it comes off to see if the tensioner is still tight against the chain. The
 tensioner at the spring side is firm.<br>
31 Aug 2008: tensioner WAS tight against the chain.

This is not an OEM chain. It was purchased from Orwell Motorcycles Ltd for 1/3rd the cost of an OEM.<br>
Curiously, the last OEM chain I bought (#4), was stamped DID.<br>
 Existing guide was retained as it was near pristine.

While the stats don't look good, I have since discovered that the re-usable oil filter I was using, has slowly clogged up
 to the point of collapse, thus restricting lubrication. The last point to see oil is the cam chain, so that's probably the
 reason this one hasn't done so well.<br>
I'll try another shortly. (14 Sep 2009)

This is the point that I discovered that the <a href="../../../03_Maintenance/12_OilAndFilter/ScottsFilter.html">re-usable oil filter</a>
 I was using, had collapsed, severely restricting lubrication. The filter has sinced been changed to a Ryco Z436,
 and the oil line to the head has been replaced with an 8mm OD Cu tube, doubling the flow capacity to the head.<br>
Just need to add an oil pressure gauge for peace of mind. That would have showed up this failure ages ago.

D.I.D. 219FTH(LE)x118 as mentioned above. It also fits Suzuki GSX 750 (F), 1989 (FK), 1990 (FL) ..... 1997 (FV) and a host of others<br>
Suppliers:<br>
 <a href="http://www.mandp.co.uk/productinfo/514263/Spares/Camchains/Economy" target="_blank">M&P Direct (UK)</a><br>
 <a href="http://www.wemoto.com/parts/picture/bc-3118002/" target="_blank">wemoto.com (UK)</a><br>
 There's a few other suppliers in the UK as well. McLeod Accessories import D.I.D. chain into Oz, but they don't do this particular one.
  They will supply the chain with a joining link, but I wouldn't recommend it for the Tornado.
