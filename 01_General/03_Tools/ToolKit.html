<P><b>Keys</b> - the book says 4 total, two normal and two flip.</p>

<p><b>Toolkit contents</b><br>
Section 6.2 "Maintenance / Tools and accessories supplied", page 62 of the Owner's Manual
 (actually p. 33 of the pdf), lists the toolkit.<br>
 - Spark plug wrench;</p>

<p><font color="maroon">the plug wrench supplied in my kit was too long to clear the frame when trying to remove
 #1 plug. I shortened it to 150 mm, by cutting off the 17mm end - the plugs are 16mm - and drilling some
 new 6.5mm holes for the crossbar. The base of the plug is 100mm below the head cover.</font></p>

Be warned guys, that black plastic circular thing in the the tool kit is the special tool for compressing
 the fuel line release buttons, if you push the buttons in with your fingers, they'll break off
 (I found out on our first LE), they only flex back & forwards and the plastic will eventually break.<br>
It's very hard to get the fuel line out of the tank without those buttons. The fuel line outlet is part of
 the fuel pump, hence expensive to replace. The factory will not replace the fuel pump if you break the
 buttons off.<br>
The other cylindrical plastic thing in the tool kit is the blanking plug for once you have removed the
 fuel line.<br>
So, if you ever take your bike to a shop for anything that requires removal of the fuel tank....... take
 those two things :-)</font></p>

If you lose it, or you never had it, here's the dimensions so that you can make it (thanks to Cam for a decent drawing)<br />

 Hands up those who have already broken the fuel line release buttons?)</p>

 - security lanyard - a curious wire cable, covered in PVC tubing. It is 590mm long, with loops at each end.</p>

<p><font color="maroon">This cable is a helmet holder. Remove the pillion seat, attach one loop to the wire
 labyrinth, thread through the helmet and back to the labyrinth. Replace the seat and your helmet is locked to the
 bike.<br>
(I think I'll stick to carrying it.)</font></p>
