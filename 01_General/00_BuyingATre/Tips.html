 also failed. The lock washer was finally replaced with a larger Belville washer and loctited. It should be inspected
 each service.</td>

  <td>Cam Chain Tensioner - Benelli don't mentioned it, BUT, it's a VERY good idea to measure the adjuster

 spring lengths varied. I've documented what I know about it
 <a href="../../05_Engine/01_Camshaft/04_Tensioner/Tensioner.html">HERE</a>. There have been a couple of cam chain
 failures which have never been explained by the factory, but I believe (in at least one case) to be due to the
 adjuster. It's not a problem if you know what the state of your engine is.</td>

<p><b><center><font size=+1>Alternator Drive Bolt</font></center></b></p>

The alternator drive bell was originally fixed to the drive shaft with a flat washer and Loctite. It came loose, allowing the shaft
 to move towards the intermediate gear. If left long enough, the intermediate gear & the Z25 gear would be severely worn
 & fail.<br>

</center>

Benelli then added the lock washer, which, as you have seen, didn't stop the bolt from loosening due to thermal
 expansion. It just limited the shaft movement, until the locating tabs on the washer broke, with obvious results.<br>
The factory then changed to a Belville washer, which allows for thermal expansion, and so far, has been reliable.<br>

<p>There have been other faults, alternator input shaft breakages & clutch cush spring control to name a couple, but these have
 been minor compared to those described above.
