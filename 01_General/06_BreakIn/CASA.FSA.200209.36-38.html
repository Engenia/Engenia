<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">EVER MET AN “engine
babyer”? You know the type, power partial on take-off and low power
in the cruise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">“Engine babyers”
usually believe that by using low power settings they are conserving
their engine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Usually this type
of thinking is the result of experience with stock automobile
engines. In reality, the operation of an aircraft engine is very
different. You will not do an aircraft engine any disservice by using
full power for take-off and 65 to 75 percent for cruise</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Many pilots are
still reluctant to fly their engines at high power settings simply
because they think they might hurt the engine. If you are one of
those pilots, perhaps it would help if you knew what your engine had
to do to prove itself before it was awarded a type certificate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Let’s say you are
flying an aircraft powered by a Teledyne Continental Motors model
0-470-R. The first production engine off the assembly is usually the
test engine for US Federal Aviation Administration type
certification.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Here is what a type
test involves. The type test engine is mounted in a test cell and
given a standard production acceptance test. After completion of this
series of runs, the engine is ready to begin its type test (also
called an endurance run). The engine is then operated at full power
(maximum rated manifold pressure and maximum rated RPM) for a period
of 50 hours. During this period, the engine’s cylinder head
temperature (CHT) and oil temperature (OT) are held in the normal
range (first 2/3 of the green arc on your aircraft gauges).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	After the first 50
hours, the engine is checked and made ready for the second 50-hour
test. During the next 50 hours, the engine is once again at full
power – only this 50 hours is at redline CHT and OT.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Imagine that: 50
hours at “full bore” at red-line temperatures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	The third and last
50-hour phase includes alternating sequences of 65-75 percent power –
all at redline CHT and OT. While the minimum number of hours required
by the FAA for testing is 150 hours, engine manufacturers often
exceed this figure by as much as two or three times, simply to
satisfy themselves the engine is trouble free.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	After all type
testing is completed, the engine is removed from the test stand,
completely disassembled and every part carefully examined. Each
moving part is checked with measuring instruments to determine if any
appreciable wear has taken place. Each part must be able to pass the
blueprint specifications for new parts.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	To replicate the
type testing regime in real-world conditions, you would have to fly
your engine at full power for six minutes every hour for 1,000 hours.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Now let’s talk
about all the other production engines that will follow the type test
engine. Each new production engine is given a standard production
acceptance test. The last part of this test is the oil consumption
run which is conducted at full throttle. The purpose of this test is
initial seating of the piston rings to the cylinder walls. The run is
conducted at full power because that is where greatest brake mean
effective pressure (BMEP) occurs and a high BMEP is necessary for
good piston ring break-in.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	The test house at
the factory determines initial piston ring seating by the amount of
oil consumed by the engine during this run. Only a few hours are
involved in the acceptance test and the new engine is by no means
completely “broken in.” The final “break-in” rests with the
pilot who will be flying the engine during the first 100 hours of its
life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>Correct “break
in”:</b> The cylinder walls of a new engine are not mirror smooth
as one might imagine. A special hone is used to put a diamond like
pattern of scratches over the entire area of the cylinder wall. The
crosshatch treatment of the cylinder walls plays an important role in
proper break-in of piston rings to cylinder walls.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Proper break-in of
piston ring to cylinder wall requires that the ring rupture or break
through this oil film and make contact with the cylinder wall. During
such “metal-to-metal” contact, the little peaks on the ring face
and cylinder wall become white hot and rub off. This condition will
continue to occur until the ring face and cylinder wall have
established a smooth compatible surface between each other.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	At this point,
break-in is said to be relatively complete and very little
metal-to-metal contact will occur hereafter. In fact,as the break-in
process progresses, the degree of metal-to-metal contact will
regress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	To get some minute
metal-to-metal contact during the break-in period, rupture of the oil
film is necessary. Two factors under the pilot’s control can retard
this necessary rupture: low power and improper lubricating oils
during the break-in period.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Engine lubricating
oils can be divided into two basic categories, compounded (detergent
and ashless dispersant) and non-compounded. The compounded oils are
superior lubricants with greater film strength than non-compounded
oils. Consequently, only non-compounded oils should be used during
the break-in period.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Some owners insist
on using additives or super lubricants along with the regular engine
oil during the break-in period. They believe that this will aid the
engine during its breaking in. With all due respect to such good
intentions, this practice is wrong and actually causes harm.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	During an oil film
rupture, only the ridges on the piston rings and cylinder walls
contact each other. The little “valleys” between the ridges
retain a film of oil and prevent a total dry condition between piston
ring and cylinder wall.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	BMEP or combustion
pressure forces the ring against the cylinder wall. This is the “key”
to the break-in process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>Glazes, valleys
and scratches:</b> You can see then that low power (low BMEP) won’t
provide the same results and the break-in process will require a
longer period of time. However, time in this instance will have a
detrimental effect on your engine because any prolonged, low power
break-in procedure usually leads to “glazed” cylinder walls.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	During each power
stroke, the cylinder walls are subjected to very high temperatures,
often 4,000°F or higher. This period is very brief but nevertheless
long enough to cause oxidation of minute quantities of some of the
lubricating oil on the cylinder walls.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Some of this
oxidation will settle into the “valleys” of the honed cylinder
wall “scratches.” Eventually this situation will fill the
“valleys” of the cylinder walls creating a smooth, flat surface.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	This is also a
normal situation; however the ring break-in process practically
ceases when these valleys become filled or “glazed” over. If this
“glazed” over process occurs before break-in is complete, in
modern day language, “you have had it.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Excessive oil
consumption resulting from incomplete ring seating will present
itself and the only certain remedy is re-honing the cylinder walls.
This is both expensive and unnecessary.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Well now you know
the whole story, let’s examine the few simple steps necessary for
proper break-in of any new, re-manufactured, major or top overhauled
engine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Pick a good
quality, non-compounded aircraft engine lubricating oil and stay with
it throughout the break-in period. Duration of the break-in period is
usually defined as the first 50 hours or until oil consumption
stabilises.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Do drain and
replace engine oil as often as recommended by your owner’s manual.
If operating conditions are unusually dusty or dirty, more frequent
draining may be necessary.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Remember, no one
ever wore out an engine by changing oil too often. Oil changes are
more critical during the break-in period than at any other time in
the engine’s life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Power: Do use full
rated power and RPM for every take-off and maintain these settings
until at least 400ft of altitude above the departing runway is
attained. At this point, reduce power to 75 per cent and continue the
climb to your cruising</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Do maintain 65-75
per cent power for all cruise operation during the break-in period.
Avoid high altitude operation with non-supercharged engines during
the break-in period. Altitudes in excess of 8,000ft density will not
permit sufficient cruise power development with non-supercharged
engines.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Interrupt cruise
power every 30 minutes or so with a smooth advance to full available
manifold pressure and RPM for 30 seconds then return to original
cruise settings (non-supercharged engines only).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	This procedure
helps to hasten a good break-in. The procedures suggested in this
paragraph apply primarily to the break-in period and are not
necessary thereafter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Avoid long
power-off let downs especially during break-in period. Carry enough
power during let down to keep cylinder head temperatures at least in
the bottom of the green.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Keep ground running
time to absolute minimums especially during warm weather. During the
break-in period, it will be better to delay departure than to sit at
the end of the runway for 15 minutes or more running in high ambient
temperatures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Be generous with
mixture controls and cooling air during break-in. All take-offs
should be with a full rich mixture except from altitudes in excess of
5,000ft and then take care to lean only enough to restore power lost
from overly rich mixtures. Make your climbs just a little flatter in
hot weather to assure adequate cooling air.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">	Follow these simple
recommendations during break-in and your engine will reward you with
a healthy service life. And above all “Don’t baby your engine
during its break-in period.”</p>
