Did quite a big ride today from southend to brighton (180miles there and back) and have finally come to the point
 where I gotta figure out what the problem is with the front end. I originally thought it was the headstock and
 so took the whole thing off, tightened and it was alot better but not cured. 2nd time round i did it a little
 too tight (only by a smidge) and although the steering as gone a bit funny its still knocking which makes me
 believe maybe it isen't just the headstock?<br>

I'm loosening it off slightly tomorrow but before I put the bike on front and rear paddock stands and strip the
 whole thing I wouldn't mind knowing if anyone else has suffered/had this problem? It only does it when I go over
 uneven tarmac, pot holes etc etc. Im just worried that it might be something a little worse? I'm checking the front
 bearings, headstock and all the usual plastic bits that might have loosened but id rather have an idea before i
 spend the day doing this?<br>

I've been a little naughty and run some 2nd and 3rd gear wheelies where I've dropped it softly but at 100mph+ and
 I think thats why the headstock came a little loose but I sh**ing it that I might have damaged something else.
 Before its said, this was happening before I mono wheeled the bike and I've never had a problem with any of my
 previous bikes italian or japanese.<br>

Any insight to this would be much appreciated, either ways I will put a post and let you know if I find anything
 out of the ordinary tomorrow</p>

It's loose bolts to the front engine hanger bracket that runs from just under the headstem to the cyl head....
.. had the same problem once here, was scratching my head after rebuilding the headstem</p>

<p><strong><center>The cause</center></strong><br>
The hanger bracket can't be tightened positively, because the bracket on the frame is not rigid.</p>

<p><strong><center>The solution</center></strong><br>
<center><img src="NewEngineMountBrace.jpg"></center><br>
Fabricate this brace, and slip it inside the frame bracket. The brace will prevent flexing, so the hanger won't
 loosen with use.</p>
