Does it not shift through the gears? I had this problem once, the locating pin came out that centralizes the
 gearshift return spring, I just took the left side 'mission cover' (the little one behind the front sprocket) off,
 deformed the pin (so it wouldn't fall out again) and tapped it back in.</p>
