Every couple of days, it dies when shifting from 2nd to first while slowing for a turn. I have always noticed it
 and just hit the starter button and kept going. Yesterday, I was getting off the highway and coming to a stoplight.
 I was braking and listening to music. I shifted from third to second, the engine died and I didn't notice it
 because of the music. As I let off of the clutch, the rear tire locked and went way squirrely on me. I kept it
 locked so it didn't pitch me and used the front brake to skid to a stop. It scared the crap out of me.<br>

I'm usually at around 4K RPMs when downshifting and do a pretty good job of matching revs. Sometimes I think it
 dies when I pull the clutch, even before I shift, but I can't be certain.<br>

Anyone else have this issue? Any ideas? I definitely need some help on this.</p>

I've had it happen to me on a few different Tornado's.  It has always been under 3000 rpm with the clutch in; the
 factory don't know exactly what it is; I have a few idea's. First things I'd do is..... re-download the 6033 map
 into the ECU, get the idle CO set to 2.0% and open the air stepper (with the Axone tool) to raise the idle to
 1,400rpm.</p>

Mine did it too when I first got it. For some reason its pretty much stopped now. Either ways I was told my mechanic
 from Red Dog here in Essex/Kent, UK, that it had something to do with the screws in the airbox. He said to cure it
 you had to turn all 3 screws fully in, then 1.5 to 2 turns out (All the same). Thats meant to cure it. The ECU thing
 doesnt sound a bad idea either??? Although he never mentioned that, only that it must have the latest 6033 map
 (assuming yours is a std model). Mine ticks over at around 1200 i think and would stall at around 2-4k. You can't
 even bump the buggers, 'cos of the slipper clutch lol</p>

He's talking about the throttle air by-pass screws, I agree, I set all three at one & half turns out, this helps
 with off-idle lurch also (giving some progression to a suddenly opening throttle butterfly) but the butterflys
 have to be synchronized at the same time though.<br>

As a quick test to see if my butterfly synchronization needs doing, I look at the exhaust headers when running
 at night, they should all glow with the same amount of redness (in neutral), if you have one that glows more red,
 you'll generally find that the butterfly for that cylinder is open a touch more than the others making that
 cylinder a little leaner, hence hotter.<br>

I also remove the throttle stop screws for cylinders 1 & 3; cylinders 1 & 3 are linked to number 2, so they are
 not needed, I don't like the possibility of them confusing any tuning issues.<br>

PS: I adjusted the air by-pass on my RS but it didn't cure the spit-back/cutting out problem... go figure?</p>

I agree that the Benelli maps need sorting, but interestingly during my recent modifications to the TNT I noticed
 that the air sensor was positioned in the corner of the air box just above the cyl head. now I think I’m right in
 saying these sensors are thermistors which work on temp differential.... the faster the air moves across the
 sensor the colder it gets, there by giving a variable signal to the ECU this signal as well as the throttle
 sensor controls fuel management. The problem is when the bike is moving slowly or is stationary the sensor is
 heated rapidly by the glowing power house (the engine) just below it therefore fooling the management system into
 immediately modifying the fuel/air mix (incorrectly)......I have repositioned and shielded my sensor to see if
 this theory is right will let you know the results.</p>

Hmmmmm (scratches head), you may be on to something guys, I was having a problem with my TnT race bike in the
 garage last night, the Axone was showing the air temp (via the bikes airbox sensor) at 50 degrees C when it
 was only 20 degrees C in the workshop, the bike was hesitating & mis-firing like it was lean.<br>
If the on-board computer thinks that it is a hot day, it will lean out the mixture BUT funny enough, the CO
 exhaust analyzer that I had connected did not show it to be lean. I'll keep searching.....</p>

Okay vtxbrit, I think you have steered me down the right path, I repositioned the air sensor (well I just hung
 it out the front of the bike for the purpose of the test), my misfiring stopped, I played around with the Axone
 and leaned out the mixture and could induce the previous misfire.<br>

As I said earlier, if the air sensor is getting warm (or the air around it), the ECU will lean out the mixture
 because it thinks it is a hot day, I guess this phenomena would be more extreme on a cold day?<br>

At low rpm, the lean spit-back through an intake port would be enough to stall the engine.<br>

I think I will mount the sensor in the front fairing, the temperature of the air in there would be much more
 exemplary of the air being inducted.... I think only for Australia though as we rarely get temperatures under
 10 C degrees.<br>

I think for the Tornado, you could mount the air sensor in either the airbox or radiator intake ducting but make
 a sheild so that incoming debris doesn't damage it.<br>

It's still early days yet, I'll do more testing this weekend, I will also send my thoughts to the factory to see
 what they think.<br>

I think this cutting-out problem that we (Tornado & TnT owners) have all been enduring could be over?..... stay
 tuned!</p>

See my TNT topic first ride since mods, very very happy, it seems all the starting and low end fuelling problems
 have almost gone I am getting it on the dyno next week then I have one more theory concerning the ignition set
 up and the way the stock ECU interprets information (or not as the case maybe).</p>

TNT - mods so far<br>
my brother builds top fuel car engines (seriously clever) and has finally given the tnt a look over after testing
 inputs/outputs etc. He said the ECU (the brain) is total sh*t and wants throwing in the bin. It cant cope with
 sudden changes in input signals, which is exactly what an engine does. He reckons to put a 16 channel proper
 controller in would cost about £600, but then it needs mapping, which could take 2-3 days on a dyno (that’s the
 expensive bit, bearing in mind his company charge high 3 figure numbers per hour for bench dyno work) I hope that
 the power commander will be a cheap compromise.<br>

BTW. The link above has been broken for a while, but I'll leave it up just in case a miracle happ[ens and it returns.</p>

TNT "first run with mods"<br>
The power commander has smoothed out all of the jerking and the "ruff" running at the low end. It’s so much
 smoother and pulls like a train, without hesitation from 2000 rpm. The devil can is sweet and without the baffle
 just quiet enough not to drive you crackers. Although the air temp was only about 12 deg the engine never went
 close to over heating.<br>
First time I’ve had a long ride without the dreaded cutting out or hot starting problem. I am convinced that with
 the 16mm new cables and the pcIII those days have gone.</p>
