<P><center><STRONG>Shock Mounting The Tip Over Switch</STRONG>
<br>16 May 2015</center></P>

<p>The tip-over switch, a mechanical contact, is normally screwed directly to the front of the airbox. When
 the engine is making high revs, the vibration can cause the switch to trigger falsely. The ECU responds by
 shutting the engine down. (This can also happen in the 900RS even though it uses a different TOS.)<br>
The bike I demo'd did this to me, and I was amused to hear Gecko's explanation - fortunately for all of us,
 they are no longer Benelli dealers.</p>

<p>The Japanese use a mercury switch, which doesn't suffer this problem. Benelli solved the problem by
 bypassing it! In fact my Tre arrived with this crazy mod! You really do need this little piece of safety
 gear, so check that it is in-circuit. Your engine will love you for it when it is lying on it's side one
 day, spooling down to zero. The alternative is - it's sitting on the rev-limiter, with no oil at the oil
 pump pickup. Your choice.</p>

<a href="http://www.benelliforum.com/forum/tornado-tre/14766-tip-over-switch-inside-view-2.html#post143543" target="_blank">mikerj reports</a> 
that the 900 RS Tip Over Switch is the same as that used by the Triumph 955i.<br>
NB: The 900 RS TOS is different to that used on the standard 900.
