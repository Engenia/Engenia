The mail come back due to rejected attachment type (zipped exe).

So this time I'll double zip the .exe with password, which is afrtuner.

Hi Errol,

I just realized that your AT was shipped with the v2.24 firmware that
doesn't yet support leaving any of the injector inputs unconnected.

Unfortunately this means that you will have to start with upgrading
the firmware to the attached unofficial pre-release v2.30.6 version.
Please make sure that the AT has a stable power feed so there is no
chance that the power will disappear during the upgrade (10-15 seconds).

This v2.30.6 is the latest unofficial build. It allows using the unit
on 1-4 cylinder engines, it has some internal improvements and it also
has the new user configurable "gear dependent self mapping throttle
ranges" user feature (I recommend leaving it on defaults for a while;
allowing the self mapping at high TP in the lower gears is not
recommended).

This firmware requires upgrading the AFR Tuner Configurator for
compatibility too. You can simply overwrite the afrtuner.exe in your
AFR Tuner installation directory with the attached new Configurator
file.

The firmware variant needed for your bike is not known yet, so I
recommend starting with 22440000.

Best regards,
Tamas
