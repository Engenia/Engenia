<p>Here's the state of tunes as posted by <i>aussievtr - Benelliforum -</i> posted 16 Feb 2006</p>

<p>Okay Ive sent them to Roland and this is what I have on the tuneboy sent to me from Wayne at Tuneboy
 and from the Power Commander site. Please note the WM (wayne Mcdonald from Tuneboy) maps are modded
 Factory maps and may void your warranty. I'm not sure about the german importer map that tuneboy does?
 If FiBlues has this map and any missing can they send it to Roland?</p>

<h2>Standard Tre Tornado</h2>

<p>6012tune.dat = 1st map for standard tre.<br>

6012TuneWM.dat = This has been modified to have a higher rev limit and richer fuel mix at the lower throttle
 positons. Ignition advance has been added at high revs, low throttle to try and stop popping.<br>

6033TuneM26s13.dat = I'm not sure if this is a factory map to replace the original 6012 map or is a TuneBoy
 modded map?<br>

<h2>Limited Editon Tornadoes</h2><br>
(please note that lastest series maps for the Standard Tre should be better than these early LE maps as the
 bikes same exactly the same engine barring the dry clutch fitted to the LE bikes.)<br>

6007_X10Tune.dat = This is the base 6007 tune as shipped with the series 1 limited production Tornado.<br>
This tune has had the last fuel map zone moved from 12001 to 12500 to allow fuel to be adjusted past the
 normal 12100 rev limit<br>
This tune is mapped for the standard pipe.(suspect this is a modded stock map)<br>

6007_X13Tunedat = This is the base 6007 tune as shipped with the series 1 limited production Tornado.<br>
This tune has had the last fuel map zone moved from 12001 to 12500 to allow fuel to be adjusted past the
 normal 12100 rev limit<br>
Mapped for the sports pipe.(suspect this is a modded stock map)<br>

6011Tune.dat = This tune was extracted from the Tornado sent to the USA for EPA testing,<br>
(before it all went to crap for the USA :-)), now they have the 6033 map I believe.<br>

<h2>RS900 Tornado maps.</h2>

6103Tune.dat = First (and only) factory map for the RS Tornado with stock can.<br>

6105Tune.dat = First (and only) factory map for the RS Tornado with the Benelli sport (Arrow) Titanium race
 can. (with the baffle removed I suspect.)<br>

<h2>TnT maps as downloaded from the Power Commander web site.</h2>

M726-000.djm = zero map, buggered if i know what this means, a blank map maybe, I havent sent this to
 Roland unitl i clarify what it is exactly.<br>

M726.501.djm = 2005 Benelli Tnt 1130 European Model.<br>
Stock exhaust.<br>
Stock Airbox.<br>
Map made in TnT mode (I take it this means the tune is when the power power is on.<br>

I dont have a 04 TnT map nor a 05 map with the power button off.<br>

Missing are i think a 6034 which is the lastest factory standard tre & LE map with the Benelli sport can
 fitted and this german importer modified map which I'm not sure is a 6033 or 6034 map
 ( ie, improved map for a tre with or without the race exhaust fitted.)<br>

Hope this is all clear to everyone.<br>

Also I'm not sure if tuneboy map can be loaded into a power commander, I think a pc trim map is the same
 a the tuneboy trim map, but i will have to check with tuneboy on that. but power commander map can be
 loaded with tuneboy and the tuneboy trim maps work exaclty as a pc does, although with tuneboy you can load
 into exact fuel amount as opposed to a fuel / air % which is from what I understand how pc maps are created.
