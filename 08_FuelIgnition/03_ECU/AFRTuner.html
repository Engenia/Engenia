<P><center><font size="+2"><STRONG>Why Install an AFR Tuner?</STRONG></font><br>(12Jul11)</center><br>
The fuelling on the 900 & 1130 is good at high revs, but less than perfect at mid to low revs, where it spends most of it's time in everyday use. Perhaps this is due Benelli's choice of injectors, noise or emissions requirements, the ability of the ECU, it's track oriented heritage, or maybe they just got it wrong. This has been discussed on the Benelliforum in the past, and no doubt will surface again.<br>
I installed a wideband oxygen (lambda) sensor to the exhaust, and took some air/fuel ratio (AFR) data, using an Inovate LM-1, under various conditions, and discovered that my 900 was running very rich at low revs, which was causing the plugs to foul. At around 6,000 rpm, & fast cruising, the fuelling was just about at stoichiometric. No surprise that that was where it delivered it's best economy.<br>
The challenge was to correct the fuel map, improving the reliability of the bike & it's endurance. I was sick of being the one who forced a fuel stop on everyone. (The 1098 is now the but of all the jokes!)</p>

<p><font size="+1"><strong>How do you change the fuel map?</strong></font><br>
A couple of possibilities :-
<ol>
 <li>Download a new map to the ECU, using a tool that talks to it, via the diagnostic connector. That tool could be the Axone 2000, or a laptop running Tuneboy, or similar application. These tools can also read & reset any error flags that the ECU has logged.<br>

<br>
<TABLE align="left" width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
   <td><center><IMG src="Axone2000.jpg" alt="Axone 2000" width="125" height="240" align="middle" border="0"></center></td>
   <td><strong>Axone</strong> is the standard tool used by Benelli, and several other manufacturers. It's ~$2000 & not that easy to come by. It can talk to many different ECU's though, if you have the right interface cable & installed software.</td></tr>
  <tr>
   <td><center>
    <IMG src="TuneBoy1.jpg" alt="TuneBoy Default Screen" width="320" height="210" align="middle" border="0">
    <IMG src="TuneBoySensors.jpg" alt="Tuneboy Sensors Window" width="320" height="218" align="middle" border="0"></center></td>
   <TD><strong>Tuneboy</strong> works similarly to Axone. It runs as an application on a PC, and talks to the ECU with a special RS232 or USB cable, but it is locked to a single ECU serial number. Certain variants are a bit smarter than the Axone though, as they can also take engine data, such as throttle position & rpm, and external data from a wideband O2 sensor, which, with the correct equation, will provide the air/fuel ratio (AFR). With this setup, you can modify your own injector timing (fuel) map.</TD>
  </tr>
</TABLE>
</li>

<li>Or, you can bypass the map in the ECU, and add a fuel controller between the ECU injector outputs, and the injectors themselves. This controller is given it's own fuel map. The ECU triggers the injector pulse, but the controller inserts it's own pulse width. This has traditionally been the domain of the Power Commander, but now Motty Electronics are challenging this, with their AFR Tuner<br>
<br>
<TABLE align="left" width="100%" border="0">
 <tbody>
 <tr>
  <td><center><IMG src="afrtuner.jpg" alt="AFR Tuner" width="320" height="224" align="middle" border="0"></center></td>
  <td><strong>The AFR Tuner (AT)</strong> is a closed loop controller. Initially, it uses the OEM ECU injector map, but it is also given a target AFR map, downloaded from a PC. It reads the current throttle position, rpm & AFR (from a wideband Oxygen sensor), and compares the actual AFR with the target AFR. It then builds & adjusts it's own fuel map to reduce the AFR error.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><center><IMG src="pc3usb.jpg" alt="Power Commander III USB" width="320" height="216" align="middle" border="0"></center></td>
  <td><strong>The Power Commander</strong>, is available now in 2 variants, PC III & PC V.<br>
  The III is open loop. Give it an injector timing map, and it will use that to control the injector times, dependant on throttle position & rpm.<br>
  The V is a recent variant. It works in a similar manner to the AT, by building it's own fuel map from the target and actual AFR values.</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody>
</TABLE>

</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><font size="+1"><strong>How do you modify the map ?</strong></font></p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The traditional way, is to hire some dyno time, and measure the power characteristics of the engine.
 <ol type="A">
  <li>Do a dyno power run</li>
  <li>Make an educated guess as to the changes required in the fuel map, in order to arrive at the ideal power characteristic & desired AFR.</li>
  <li>Upload the newly modified map to the ECU, or fuel controller</li>
  <li>Repeat A B & C until the AFR error is acceptable</li>
 </ol>
</li>
<br>
<li>The long winded, but far cheaper and more "real world" method of determining the new map, is to record data under repeatable conditions.
 <ol type="A">
  <li>Go for a ride & record the throttle position, rpm and AFR under known conditions - terain, temperature, aggression etc.</li>
  <li>Analyse the data in much the same way as would be done when using a dyno. An educated guess is made for each fuel map cell, in an attempt to move the AFR to the desired value (~13:1 for power, 15:1 or higher, for economy).</li>
  <li>Upload the newly modified map to the ECU, or fuel controller</li>
  <li>Repeat A B & C until the AFR error is acceptable</li>
 </ol>
The data is recorded with the help of TuneBoy or other data recorder, such as an Innovate 
<a href="http://www.innovatemotorsports.com/products/lm2.php" target="_blank">LM-2</a> or LM-1 (obsolete) + 
<a href="http://www.innovatemotorsports.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16153&cat=0&page=1" target="_blank">LMA-3</a>
</li>
<br>

<li>Then there is the automated method. A closed loop controller measures the AFR for each cell in the map, as it encounters it. It then makes an adjustment and builds it's own map. At the end of the ride, you choose whether to store the new map permantly, or discard it. This requires an AT or PCV.<br>
The beauty of this automated method, is that the map is adjusted constantly, as changes occur in altitude, air flow (filter clogging), exhaust back pressure (changed or failing can) or even fuel pressure.
</li>
</ol>
The last method covers all the bases, and is the system I installed. It resulted in a dramatic improvement in fuel economy, from around 220 km from a tank, to over 300.<br>
 As a bonus, the AT provides an extra map. One I use when I'm looking for economy on transport sections. The other, the "go faster" map, can be switched in when the road gets "squirrely", providing power immediately from 4000 rpm, to the limiter.

<p>Two ways. Either with minimal loom modification, or, not.<br>
The former is the way #922 is wired. It requires the creation of cable stubs, to make connections using the standard connectors. Some of these are difficult to acquire.<br>
The latter requires the unwrapping of the main loom from stern to just behind the engine, and splicing into the relevant wire, using soldered joints. With this method, Items 5 to 13, in the Parts List below, can be deleted.</p>

The following describes the minimal loom modification method<br>
1. Connecting Main pin 20 to P1E4 MAY result in a cleaner TPS signal, but I haven't tried it.<br>
2. Only 4 wires are spliced into the loom. All other connections are made by adding cable stubs.<br>
3. The wire colours chosen, are not necessarily those found in the loom supplied by Motty.<br>

The Lambda probe will fit just in front of the exhaust pipe mount, but behind the gearbox, angled to miss the clutch cover. I
 shaped the collar base to fit the curvature of the pipe, marked the position on the pipe, then drilled a hole in the pipe, just
 large enough to allow the probe to fit through. A bolt then held the collar in position for welding.

<p>The AT will fit in the duck tail, between the fans as shown above, if the fusebox is raised, moved left, or allowed to float
 freely. Initially, just lift it off it's clip. The top of the AT metal case should be protected from connecting to the frame by
 super gluing a piece of PETE (from a 2 litre juice bottle) to it.<br>
Motty supply 4 pieces of Dual Lock in the AT kit. Clean off the fan & AT housings with isopropyl alcohol, and when dry, stick 2 to
 the end of the AT (as shown), then slip it into position. Rotate the part sticking to the fan, so that it follows the curvature of
 the fan housing. Next, remove the AT & stick the remaining 2 pieces to it's underside, in a position that will line up with the
 right housing.<br>
I raised the fusebox by rotating it's clip through 180<sup>o</sup>. An extra notch is required though, and the pillion seat will touch it.
