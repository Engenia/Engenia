<p>I have been digging and	digging and then dug some more. It seems Benelli owners aren't the only ones suffering
 from burnt/shorted coils. Wherever and whatever they are fitted on, suffer from coil problems!!!</p>

<p>Now this is	a diverse coil which was originally made by Sagem, which was taken over from Johson Controls
 International (JCI) which has now been	engulfed by Valeo!!!</p>

<p>It is fitted to Alfa's, Fiat's,	Lancia's, Renault's, Citroen's, Peugeot's( on their respective 3L V6's) and
 Aprilia's.</p>

<p>All the info I have has come from the Aprilia forum, which I have cross checked with the manufacturers (Valeo)
 and the carmakers websites.</p>

<p>Prices for the coils varied from A$330 Benelli and 6 week wait, A$185 Renault in stock, A$93 Citroen in stock
 and A$85 Peugeot in stock. It goes without saying, that afternoon I was knocking on my local Peugeot Dealers
 door(Melbourne City Peugeot) and bought 3 over the counter. With very little modification and about half an
 hour later, I had 3 brand new coils ready to fit to my Tornado! For modification/info details see </p>

<p>This explanation is in French (it was, until I translated it using Google Translate & Freetranslation.com
 . I also removed the references to work not required for our Tornados - Ed.), but the pictures are that
 good, it is easy enough to follow. The other plus is that the high tension end which attaches to the plug
 is identical and does not require modification for fitment to the Benelli. The only thing you have to do
 is cut the end cap. I carefully used a hacksaw blade, and sealed the cap with silicon. I also sprayed a
 hard drying anti corrosive film over it, for obvious reasons. The result is an identical coil!!!</p>

<p>The primary and secondary coil specs seem spot on as well. An Aprillia member quotes over 10,000 km without a
 problem.</P>

<p><B>PRELIMINARY INFORMATION : </B></p>
<p><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">This is a collaborative work. Brittany & Eliso having worked on their own, on a number of
 different solutions on the adaptation of coils. They arrived at the same conclusions, representing the best
 compromise.<BR>

Their two bikes were equipped with modified coils that functioning perfectly, after having covered each about 1500 km. 
<BR>

Moreover, the coils have exactly the same electrical characteristics as the originals : <BR>

<font color="maroon">(Ed: Aaron, of the Benelliforum, pointed out that PBTP-GF20 stands for "Poly Butylene Terephthlate
 with 20% glass fibre". It has nothing to do with the electrical characteristics of the coil)</font></p>

Values electrical coils of Capo N<BR>
Primary: 0.6 ohms + /-10% (from 0.54 to 0.66)<BR>
Secondary or HT: 10 KOhms + /-10% (from 9 to 11)<BR><BR>

Electrical values of the Valeo coil measured on seven coils:
Primary: 0.6 to 0.7Ohms.
Secondary: 9.91 to 9.98KOhms.<BR><BR>

To measure the values of the secondary, it is not possible to do it as explained in the workshop manual.
 To know that the diode is operating, it is necessary to withdraw the top of the spool, and touch one Ohm
 meter lead to diode upstream, & touch the other on the central point of the coil (HT side)<BR>
