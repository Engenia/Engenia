<br>(02 Dec 07)</center></P>

<p>You'll find it to the right of the throttle bodies. It has 3 tubes, each of which connect below a butterfly</p>

<p>Here's an explanation from <i>colintornado - Benelliforum -</i>, posted April 2007</p>

<p>What is described as the "stepper", is the idle air control valve. It is a stepper motor. It moves in set increments,
 by receiving inputs from the electronic control module. The motor moves a rod in and out, to open and shut the airflow
 from the airbox, to the throttle bodies, below the butterfly valves. The ecm is set to idle at, say 1200rpm, and it
 uses inputs from several sensors, and then regulates the stepper and fuel injection and ignition.<br>
The stepper could fail and cause rich and poor running. If you look in the airbox, the stepper can be seen on right
 side. If the engine is run, the stepper can be seen to move, if revved up and down. You can see a white plunger that
 uncovers the little ports to the outlet pipes.<br>
Tuneboy has a test for the stepper. Not sure if axone can do this. Both may show fault codes for stepper failure.</p>

<p> ... the stepper on the 1130 engines are to control the fast idle (choke) only and not the tick-over. The 1130
 engines have a tick-over screw, as the stepper is completely shut once engine is up to operating temperature.
 The stepper on the 900 engine does control the tick-over as colintornado has explained</p>

<p>Hmm thats interesting Dodgy, but when I looked in the manuals, it does still imply the stepper is controlling the
 idle. The setting is lower than the 900, but if setting the CO on tnt1130, it tells you to check the stepper setting
 as the mixture is altered, to make sure it is on 10 to 15, and it says it is constantly altering. Therefore controling
 idle to some point? Perhaps the setup has been changed and the manual I have is incorrect ??, If the stepper valve
 was faulty or stuck, i think it could be caferacers problem? Triumph 3s seem to have trouble with the stepper valve.</p>

<p>The latest info on the 1130 motor says to set the throttle bodies at full operating temp as the stepper is shut and
 this provides a good point to set the butterflies</p>

<p>and finally, <i>colintornado - Benelliforum -</i> replied ...</p>

<p>obviously from what Dodgy says the setup is a bit different on the 1130 compared to the 900 motors, but if starting
 from cold, I would expect the ports in the stepper to be open,even if they shut completely upon reaching a set temp.
 I dont think you should be able to move the plunger manually.<br>
If the engine runs too rich from cold, and is ok if warm, and the stepper is shut all the time, then the stepper
 seems the cause. If your bike is under warrenty a visit to dealer may be required.<br>
Just read your other post about dealer! If stepper is not moving,you could check conections etc and you could check
 as per the manual fault diagnosis.</p>
