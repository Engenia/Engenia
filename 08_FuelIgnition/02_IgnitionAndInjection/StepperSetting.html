<P><center><STRONG>The Stepper - How to set it</STRONG>
<br>(20 Mch 15)</center></P>

<p>Here's an explanation from <i>colintornado - Benelliforum -</i>, posted 27 Sep 2007</p>
<p>My RS does not stall,(1350rpm idle) but if stalling is a problem, there are a few things to consider.</p>

<p>0) the throttle bodies should be balanced before doing anything!<br>
1) When a new map is installed etc, the throttle position sensor should be checked to confirm that is on "0" when shut,
 and reset it if required.<br>
2) The stepper setting should then be checked to see that it is on 30-40 on idle (tre900).<br>
3) When the CO (carbon monoxide) is set (1 - 3 %) {1% = veggies; 3% = meat eaters (IUSWIM)}, then the stepper must be
 rechecked to see that it is still within the limits. If not, it can be adjusted back correct.<br>
If it is low it may be that the injector body valves are set open more than they should be.<br>
If they are set right the stepper will be correct.</p>

<p>The stepper position is important.</p>

<p>All of this is part of the normal maintainance procedure, and is in the manuals if you want a read up.<br>
 There could be faults on the tps or a sticky stepper etc... that would also cause stalling etc.... then again
 if everything was perfect we would only get bored!</p>

<STRONG>Stepper Operation At Power Up And Power Down</STRONG><br>

It starts partially open, and moves to fully open when powered up.<br>
At power down, the stepper closes fully and continues attempting to step - you can hear it if you listen carefully. This is the ECU making sure that the stepper has hit the stop. It then reverses off of the stop a fixed number of steps, and the ECU powers down. In this way, the ECU always starts from a known position.<br>
This is the cold operation for my Tornado (Sagem ECU), but I'm pretty sure it does the same thing when warm.
